    "content": "22.06.202520: 11 Tatragia Trzepiecińska\nHer heart has always been beating more to dance. Oliwia Niewiadomska is the founder of one of the most recognizable overserayal formations in Poland. The Fame team has been operating for 20 years and has numerous successes, including multiple titles of Polish champions and international performances.\nOliwia Niewiadomska is a graduate of the Music Academy in Katowice at the Faculty of Theory and Music Education. For many years, she taught children with commitment at various stages of education, but her real passion has always been to dance music. Twenty years ago, fate encountered her with a completely new challenge - the creation of a majorette team.\n- There were no similar bands in central Poland at the time - recalls Oliwia. - The director of the extracurricular classes No. 1 in Łódź, Mrs. Królikowska, proposed to create an alternative form of dance classes. Case? I don't believe in cases. Everything is happening for something - smiles Olivia.\nThis is how the Fame team was born, which over the years transformed not only into a forge of talents, but above all in a place where passion turns into a lifestyle.\nThe band Fame today is nearly 70 people, from first graders to adults with over 17 years of stage experience. The formation also includes a unique group of Grand Senior, in which the average age reaches forty.\n- He doesn't have age limits with us. There are students, parents, teachers, even our driver. We are unity on stage - says Oliwia. - Sometimes mom and daughter dance together and both have the same flash in their eyes. I am also at the Senior Grand. Last year we won the title of Polish champions in the show category. For me, Fame is a community and passion for me, which has been going on for 20 years. Our group can be attached all the time, and the sooner someone begins, the easier it will be to enter the rhythm and develop in dance - explains the founder of the band.\nThe team has impressive achievements - only last season they won 78 medals! In April 2025, the dancers stood on the podium of the Polish Sports Association Championships several times, which gave them a pass to the MWF European Championships in the Italian Monza. To be able to represent Poland on the international arena, Fame runs a collection on the Pomamam.pl platform, entitled: \"Fame for the European Championships 2025\".\n- The girls got to the elimination and want to make their dream come true. But such a trip is huge costs: transport, accommodation, costumes, starting fees. That is why we need help - explains Oliwia. - Faculty zloty is not only a ticket to Italy, it is an investment in young people, in their development, in the values ​​of dance - discipline, cooperation and self -confidence - he adds.\nBehind the band's success, next to Oliwia - the founder and soul of the formation, is the experienced coaching staff: Adam Pigłowski (known for \"Dancing with the Stars\" and \"What a melody\"), his sister Daria Pigłowska and Patrycja Zarębska, who herself began as a dancer in Fame.\n- For me, the biggest achievement is not medals. True success is to see how my girls grow up, become trainers and pass on passion further - says Oliwia.\nThe band specializes in modern sports dance - with pompoms, bars, flags and maces. Among the dancers is also Oliwier, a raisin in a female group.\n- He starts at seven in the morning to train in front of school. Such enthusiasts are a treasure - says Olivia. - Fame is not only dance, it's a school of life. When I see my former schoolgirls, today women who inspire others, I know that it all makes sense - he explains.\nMajorettes are currently an official sports dance discipline, derived from the traditions of military parades. Their beginnings date back to the times when they accompanied the marches of troops and encouraged to get into the army. A characteristic stick, so -called The bar symbolized the weapon, and today it has a technical and aesthetic function in choreographies. Majorette movement has developed over the years, creating two mainstles: classic and sports. Contemporary performances of majorettes combine elements of dance, acrobatics and artistic gymnastics, require a high level of precision, synchronization and physical fitness.\nArt is available to everyone. The conjunction studio in Łódź is a meeting place, conversations and experiments\nNext to Panama Studio you can't pass indifferently!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź.

However, there is a problem with it, because there were a lot of these enterprises.\nInstead of a note about selected factories from Łódź, half a century ago - which would take several episodes of our cycle anyway - we created a list of the largest to recall memories and honor tens of thousands of employees who, for several post -war decades, produced various goods in them. In addition to textile, in the 70s were also factories from the food, chemical, machine and electromechanical industries. Some factories, such as Uniontex or Poltex, employed up to 10,000 people, and many of them - over a thousand workers. Today, after most companies from those times, there is no trace.\nHere is a list of factories of the former Łódź (in brackets we provide old address details).

See it from the inside - corridors, cash registers and descent to the platforms.\nClick on the photos above to see the gallery from the new Łódź Kaliska station.\nThe beginning of Łódź Kaliskas reed in 1898. When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

    "content": "20.06.20256: 27 sponsored partition\nThere is a lack of money in your home budget? You don't know how to manage expenses to accumulate some savings? It's much easier than it seems. Learn 5 ways to effectively take care of the budget.\nOne of the most important saving rules is regularity. This is the basis for a financial pillow to be successfully built. Try to postpone a certain amount every month, and after some time you will manage to accumulate a large sum. And what you do with the money saved depends only on you!\nExpenses related to running a household consume a very large part of income. They cannot be avoided, but they can be slightly minimized. All you have to do is change your daily habits and an additional sum may be in the budget.\nTo save a bit, you can:\nchange the current tariff or electricity supplier,\nreplace bulbs for energy -saving models,\nexclude unused electronic devices from the sockets,\ngive up bathing for the shower,\nseal taps,\nUse pearltors.\nDo you and household members have subscription phones? Think about changing the plan to a cheaper variant. Find out which operator offers the possibility of using a family subscription covering several numbers.\nDo you pay streaming services every month? Think if you really use them. If you run them 1-2 times a month, it's time to give them up.\nDo you spend a lot of money for take -out coffee? Get a high -quality thermal mug and fill it with an aromatic drink at home. Thanks to this, you will always have your favorite coffee at hand without additional expenses.\nIt is also a good idea to set up a Łódź card. It authorizes discounts in many places, such as shops, museums, restaurants and doctor's offices. It's a great way to save a bit on services you use regularly!\nShopping can make a lot of joy, but they are also a burden on the home budget. If you want to avoid buying things you don't really need, plan very carefully, what goes to the basket in a stationary or online store. Do not be guided by emotions that can be a bad adviser.\nBefore you go shopping at the market, check the current promotional newspapers. Thanks to them you will find out where you can buy the articles you need the cheapest. Remember to always prepare a exact shopping list. In this way, you will reduce the risk that you will actually need to be the basket that you do not need.\nA deposit is a contract concluded between the bank and the client. Savings on it is an effective way to multiply them. By setting up a deposit, you undertake to pay a specific amount for a specified time. In return, the bank undertakes to pay them increased by profits, i.e. interest. Importantly, the capital accumulated on the deposit is safe, because it is covered by the protection of the Bank Guarantee Fund in the event of a bank's insolvency.\nIf you want to save on a deposit, compare at least a few different offers. You can do this by using the tool available at: https: //rankomat.pl/finanse/lokaty/. A practical comparison machine will help you comfortably and quickly check the suggestions of various banks.\nBefore you make the final decision, pay attention primarily to:\ninterest rate - your profits depend on it,\nThe frequency of capitalization of interest - the more frequent it is, the more you earn,\nThe effects of earlier termination of the contract - the payment of funds from the deposit before the deadline may mean the loss of all or part of the profits generated.\nThe minimum and maximum deposit amount is also important. It depends on what amount you can deposit on the deposit. If you are interested in an attractive offer, verify its conditions.\nA good solution is to set up a savings account on which you will accumulate surplus funds. Banks most often offer higher interest rates than in the case of classic personal accounts.  This is to encourage long -term saving.\nUnlike a deposit, you can freely withdraw funds from such an account and supply them with any sum. You have access to your money whenever you need it. Most often, the first few transfers from the savings account are free, but it all depends on the specific offer of the bank. If you are planning to open the invoice, check the information available at: https: //rankomat.pl/finanse/konta/konta-bankowe/.\nSaving is a habit that is worth working out. Building a financial pillow is a way to secure your future and loved ones. Thanks to it, you will be prepared for unplanned expenses related to e.g. home equipment failures. Saving does not have to be associated with large sacrifices if you approach this topic accordingly."

In the Łódź region, the celebrations of this day have a unique, deeply rooted character and are an important element of local cultural identity.\nFor generations, the faithful in the cities and villages of the Łódź Voivodeship have participated in solemn Holy Masses and Eucharistic processions, which pass through the streets of the parish, stopping at four altars symbolizing the Gospels. The events in smaller towns have a special setting, where residents prepare decorations together, arrange floral carpets and decide the houses and processions routes with greenery and banners.\nIn Łódź, a traditional archdiocesan procession gathers thousands of faithful every year, traversing the streets of the city center - from the Church of Our Lady of Victory to the Archcathedral Basilica of St. Stanisław Kostka. This event has not only a religious, but also a social dimension - it connects generations and reminds of the values ​​of community, respect and spirituality.\nParticularly noteworthy are the celebration of the Corpus Christi in Łowicz and Spycimierz, which every year attracts crowds of pilgrims and tourists from all over Poland and abroad. In Łowicz, a city with a rich folk tradition, the Corpus Christi procession is one of the most colorful events in the whole country. The faithful, clergy and residents go in a procession in traditional Lowicz folk costumes, and the whole city is teeming with folklore, music and prayer. It is a spiritual and cultural spectacle that has become a symbol of regional identity and pride.\nIn turn, in Spycimierz, a small village near Uniejów, Corpus Christi is known for its unique habit of laying multi -colored, several hundred meters of live flowers. This unique rite, cultivated for over 200 years, in 2021 was inscribed on the list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity UNESCO. Crowds of faithful participate in the procession passing through the flower carnisis, as well as people visiting Spycimierz to see this amazing phenomenon with their own eyes.\nOut of passion to horses.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass.

However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets.

The suit, which will be founded by Uznański-Wiśniewski, combines modern technology with an eye-catching, minimalist design. Keep in dark colors, with streamlined lines and subtle accents, he gained the name of the \"suit of the future\".\nInternet users are divided-some express pride and enthusiasm, others with a grain of salt compare the appearance of the astronaut to the hero of the science-fiction film. Regardless of the opinion, one thing is certain-Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski will not only fly into space, but he will do it with class and in a style that has already become a symbol of the new era in the Polish presence in space.\nCorpus Christi in Łódź.

The project is planned to build a sewage system with a total length of 15.2 km in Łódź. The new network will appear, among others, in Street Columns on the section from ul. Zygmunta to ul.

By connecting the house to the urban sewage system, they will go to a group sewage treatment plant, which will clean them properly.\nUsing the sewage system is not only convenience for residents, but above all real savings.

Piotrkowska 61 The star of Bożena Dykiel, one of the most popular and characteristic actresses of theater, cinema and television, will be unveiled. An actress who dazzles both in \"Promised Land\" and in the \"emergency exit\".\nBożena Dykiel was born on August 26, 1948 in Grabów near Kolno. She grew up in Warsaw, where in 1971 she graduated from the acting department of the State Theater School in Warsaw. Already during her studies, she played at the Student Satirków Theater (STS), and later joined the National Theater in Warsaw. Under the direction of Adam Hanuszkiewicz, she played her most important theater roles. She was a muse in \"Beniowski\", Julia in \"Three to Three\", the Bride in \"The Wedding\" and Goplana in \"Balladyna\" (premiere 1974). It was Bożena Dykiel who in this extravagant staging of the work of Juliusz Słowacki entered the stage on a motorcycle and recited her issue. The performance celebrated triumph, they were staged nearly four hundred times, and they were watched by over 300,000 people.\nOn the big screen, she debuted in 1972 with the role of hitchhiking in \"Emptiment as close as possible\" by Janusz Zaorski. For over half a century she starred in over seventy films. Her most important roles include those in Andrzej Wajda's films - Kasia in \"Wedding\", the already mentioned Mada Müller in \"Promised Land\", HR in \"Iron Man\", Wirgińska in \"Biesach\". She collaborated with Jerzy Hoffman at \"Znachor\", Andrzej Barański - \"Knight's life in exile\" and \"Two moons\" and Krzysztof Kieślowski - \"Decalogue VII\".\n>> The rest of the text is below <<\nThe next chapter of Bożena Dykiel's work is her rich comedy and serial achievements. She is the unforgettable wife of the house host in \"Alternatives 4\" and the wife of Michał Roman in \"Brunet in the evening\" by Stanisław Barea, the head of the commune Jadwiga Kollema in Roman Załuski's \"emergency exit\" by Roman Załuski, Kokoszka, and Solidarity in \"Solidarity\" in \"Controlled conversations\" by Sylwester Chęciński. Episodes in the films of Marek Koterski - a dentist in \"Nothing funny\" and a neighbor on \"Freak Day\" have grown to the rank of iconic. TV viewers certainly remember her from roles in such popular series as \"Na Wspólnej\" (Maria Zięba played over 20 years), \"President\", \"For good and for bad\".\nBożena Dykiel - as critics wrote in the context of her theater and film roles - she is a strong and wayward heroine. So strong that in the mid -70s of the last century the strength of the communist regime's security apparatus did not succumb. For two years, the Security Service tried to force the actress - privileges and threats - to cooperate. She was to make the Diplomat of Germany to intimate relations. SB planned to film and compromise the married man. She didn't bend.\nThe actress is constantly enjoying the popularity of a large group of cinema fans. An expression of this is honoring her during the 7th Festival of Stars in Międzyzdroje - in 2002 she squeezed her hand on the promenade of stars, and on July 2, 2025, her star will shine on Piotrkowska Street - in Aleja Aleja in Łódź. Her artistic achievements were also appreciated by the state authorities - in 1979 she was awarded the Bronze Cross of Merit, and in 2022 she received the silver medal \"Merit to Culture Gloria Artis\".\nThe unveiling of the star will start at 16:00. At 17:00 at NCKF Street Targowa 1/3, a meeting with the actress and the screening of the film \"Emergency exit\" will take place.\nRobert Metsool with a doctorate of honoris causa of the Lodz University of Technology.

Check what the passage will look like after the changes!\nWide, in places four lanes, al. Bandurski and Walter-Jan in Łódź are the bane of pedestrians and a place where drivers significantly exceed the speed. Pedestrians have over 10 -meter roadways at these intersections. There are also no journeys for cyclists, despite bicycle paths that are along these avenues.\nAlong with the construction of a new bicycle route to Walter-Jan (from civic to Wyszyński), the old street layout had to be adapted to the new traffic rules, which clearly say that there can be no pedestrian crossing without traffic lights, for more than one lane. Therefore, at Wyszyński in Łódź, where we have a vast intersection and various directions of traffic, a light signaling was built. Signaling will stop vehicles at Bandurski and certainly will not pass the passage, but will provide a safe walking, the possibility of creating a crossing for cyclists and will eliminate collisions at the intersection.\nDue to the short distance between Wyszyński, Marathon and the Pienista in Łódź, no subsequent signals were built that could block traffic in this area. That is why a new belt layout has been painted to adapt traffic organizations to applicable regulations. Three, we will have two lanes to travel. Right and left, without the middle, which will be turned off to create a pedestrian asylum at the crossing and thus, ensure a prescribed and safe road crossing.\nImportant changes in traffic organization at Traugutt in Łódź.

However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one.

All thanks to the unique tradition of laying flower rugs - a custom nurtured for over 200 years.\nThanks to the involvement of the local community, this extraordinary form of artistic expression was entered on the National List of intangible cultural heritage, and in 2021 also on the international UNESCO list. According to the messages, they brought custom soldiers to Spycimierz. Initially, the compositions were made of sand and twigs. In the 20th century, they gained a more complex form, in which flowers - both wild and garden - became the dominant material.\nWork on carpets start many days before the holiday. Residents share their duties: some collect plants, others sketch patterns, subsequent ones arrange intricate compositions. All this to create a unique, up to 2 kilometers long route decorated with religious and patriotic symbols.\nThe highlight of the celebration is a solemn procession, which sets off at 17:00. The priest carries the Blessed Sacrament among the colorful carpet, surrounded by children who spilled the firefighting orchestra. Decorated with birches, pennants and ribbons, the streets create an unusual scenery for this event.\nThe universities of the Uniejów commune created the \"Spycierskie Corpus Christi\" center - a modern educational space with multimedia exhibitions, workshops and the possibility of virtual walks.\nThe flower carpets in Spycimierz are not only a religious and artistic attraction - it is primarily a live heritage that connects generations, integrates the local community and attracts an increasing number of visitors from all over Poland and the world.\nYou can find a photo report from last year's Corpus Christi in Spycimierz.\nThis is the 15th edition of the \"folk inspiration\" festival.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

You will quickly delete it and avoid unnecessary stress when, for example, you do not have coverage on your phone.\nOnce MPK Łódź tickets could only be bought in stores and kiosks. Most people using buses and trams had several tickets in the portfolio in case they had to suddenly use public transport.\nThere are fewer kiosks, but we can buy tickets in every MPK Łódź vehicle, using ticket machines in them, in stationary vending machines, as well as using mobile applications. Theoretically, we do not have to worry that the store will be closed and we will have nowhere to buy a ticket. It is worth remembering, however, that sometimes it is good to buy a ticket earlier.\nBoth MPK Łódź ticket machines and telephones are just devices. It may happen that they stop working or cannot connect to the Internet or our bank. In the event of a ticket machine failure, we can continue the journey without a ticket. In the case of inspection, after confirming the fault, the controller will sell us a ticket for PLN 6.80. It is worse when our private phone refuses to obey or, for example, we will not have coverage to pay for the journey.\nIt is worth remembering that in both ticket machines and mobile applications, we can buy tickets earlier. In Łódź, unlike some cities (e.g. Warsaw), tickets bought in vending machines are not immediately deleted. So we can buy a few tickets and put it in your wallet for another journey.\nThe situation is similar in mobile applications. Tickets can be bought and saved in our application. We delete them only by activating the special QR code. With several tickets saved in our virtual portfolio, we do not have to worry about whether we have funds on the account or whether we can connect to the bank at the moment to pay for the journey.\nMPK Łódź tickets can be bought in applications: Lodz.pl, Zbiletm.pl, like Dojade, Mobilet, MPay, SkyCash and in the applications of many banks.\nImportant changes in traffic organization at Traugutt in Łódź.

In 1913, the factory complex consisted of a mechanical weaving room, a spinning mill, a dyeing room, a printing house, a locksmith workshop and a carpentry shop. In 1920, a family joint -stock company was established. During World War II, the plant was still conducted by the Eiserts. In 1945, the factory was nationalized and from 1950 she wore them.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź.

    "content": "15.06.202519: 38 Patravja Trzepiecińska\nJulia and Kamila met in college and became friends. They were combined by passion for patterns, colors and experimenting with fabric. Together they decided to create something special. Panama Studio is a brand that has quickly gained recognition from the design and heart industry.\nJulia Lutheracka and Kamila Lewandowska met at the Academy of Fine Arts in Łódź, where they studied fabric design. This is where their joint fascination with jacquard was born - a weaving technique that requires patience, precision and creativity. After graduation, they gained a full -time work experience, but they quickly began to dream of something of their own. In 2023 they decided to set up Panama Studio, and built the brand in just two months.\n- It was a spontaneous decision. However, we had joint experiences in working on the previous project, so it came out naturally and quite efficiently, although we do not recommend such pace. Today, if we did it again, we would devote more time to it - say Julia and Kamila.\nPanama is today their main occupation, not only professional, but also life. They design, test and create.\n- We met jacquard in college and wanted to explore his possibilities outside the student workshop - say Julia and Kamila. It was this weave that became a weapon of expression for them. - In Żakard, we love the possibilities of combining weave planes, the process of interpreting the artistic project to the language of Krosno. It has its limitations, which we like to face. These are challenges for us that bring a lot of joy in implementation - they explain.\nDesigns are created in graphic programs and end as digital files readable for Krosna software.\n- We are constantly coming up with ideas that we confront with recipients and production capabilities. Factal jacquard are less common than knitting or printing houses, so each implemented project enjoys even more - they add.\nThe rest of the article is below.\nIn 2024, Panama Studio won the \"must have\" distinction for collections of Zakdki and Scouts.\n- It's very nice! We are pleased that such a distinction goes to fabric designers. This is a sign that our products like and are needed - say Kamila and Julia. Local context also matters to them. - It is important that being from Łódź we are locally appreciated by such a wonderful event - they add.\nDuring this year's Łódź Design Festival they presented the \"Playfool\" screen. - This is a concept that goes a bit beyond the fabric design framework. It's great that we can present it in this place - say designers.\nKamila and Julia are frequent guests at the design fair.\n- These are our favorite events. We can meet people, see how they react to our designs, talk. This is a huge value - emphasizes Kamila.\nThe fair is also a space to exchange experiences with other creators.\n- We feel like creative colonies, intense, creative and very inspiring - adds Julia.\nIn the summer, Panama releases a new collection. A light, holiday version of jacquard. Towels, bathrobes, bags.\n- This is a new chapter for us. Panama was associated with blankets and rugs so far. Now we want us to accompany our clients also in the summer: on the beach, plot, on the go - the designers announce.\nThe name \"Panama\" refers to the weaving technique, specifically to the Panama weave - a variation of the classic canvas weave. In this technique, instead of one warp thread (i.e. threads running along the fabric, placed on the looms) and one thread of the thread (i.e. threads intertwined with transversely, slipped between the warp), two threads on each side are intertwined. Thanks to this, the fabric structure becomes more expressive, and the weave itself is often used in decorative and clothing fabrics.\nArt is available to everyone.

The inhabitants of Łódź went to Leszno, where they faced the leader. Unfortunately, nothing came out in this match. After the fighting team there was no shadow of the trace. The Union definitely won 60:30. In addition, the eagle fell to the last place in the table. After such a match, it is difficult to distinguish someone, so let's only note that Andreas Lyager brought 8 points, the same number of Robert Chmiel, and after 6 Patryk Wojdyło and Vaclav Milik.\nIt will be difficult to find rehabilitation.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

    "content": "14.06.202514: 56 Patraja Trzepiecińska\nShe did not dream of a film school, she never had a computer, and she came across an animation by accident. Today, Magdalena Parszewska runs his own animation studio in Łódź - Animusz Studio - and teaches others how to breathe life into immovable images.\nShe is a boat by birth and by choice.\n- Here I grew up, lived, studied - says Magdalena Parszewska. - In my family, no one had anything to do with a movie or art. My grandmother raised me, and I tried three times to get to the Academy of Fine Arts. It didn't work out. And maybe good - Magda laughs.\nInstead of another defeat, there was a spontaneous decision - an application to the Film School in Łódź for the direction of animation.\n- I got the first time. It was one of the better decisions in my life - he emphasizes. She began her studies without a computer and without prior contact with the animation. - Fortunately, we created the first film on the film tape. It was beneficial to me. I like contact with matter, I like to work with my hands, experience the world with all my senses - he explains.\nIn 2019, Magda opened her own animation studio.\n\"I've always wanted to be independent,\" he says. - Art professions rarely give stable employment. I preferred to take a chance and see if I could manage myself - he explains. Although Pandemia stopped everything right after the start, Magda did not give up.\nIn Animusz Studio, short animated forms are created, from light and funny to experimental and socially involved. The studio cooperates with both cultural institutions and commercial clients. Magda is not afraid to combine various techniques, from classic 2D, through the plasticine animation, to more and more often used 3D elements.\n- I like to act in various aesthetics. For me, creation and surprise is more important than technical perfection. I prefer an experiment than a perfectly smoothed movement - says Magda.\nThe rest of the text is below.\nMagda is active in the field of artistic education. He conducts animation workshops for children, adolescents and adults - both in cooperation with cultural institutions and as an independent educator.\n- I have been leading them a little less lately, because I teach regularly at a private post -secondary school. I miss the workshops in an open formula and I am looking for a space where you could lead them again permanently - he explains.\nOne of her more unusual workshop projects is \"reviving collage\", i.e. classes combining analogue art techniques with simple digital tools.\n- What makes me most happy is interest. Despite the widespread access to application and artificial intelligence, people still want to create manually. This is especially visible among people from creative industries. They want to go back to matter, touch, build something from scratch - notes Magda.\nIn a duet with a friend, theater director and animator, Magda creates visualizations for performances.\n- This experience is completely different than working at the computer. On the theater plan there is contact with people, exchange of energy, immediate reaction, which is often lacking in digital animation. And maybe that's why the theater attracts me so much - he explains.\nMagda's greatest passion is the top -frame animation, especially the one implemented in puppet technique.\n- Working with a doll calms me down, draws me completely. It's a kind of meditation. For me, kidding animation is not only a way of making a film, but a work philosophy. Release, focus, contact with matter. Although less and less such projects are implemented, it is worth fighting for them - sums up Magda.\nSingle animation involves taking a series of photos of objects that are slightly sliding between successive shots. In plasticine animation, the creators model characters from plastic materials that can be freely formed. The puppet version uses special dolls with a movable skeleton, allowing for precise position setting. This type of animation requires enormous precision - as many as 24 photos are needed for one second of the film.\nArt is available to everyone. The conjunction studio in Łódź is a meeting place, conversations and experiments\nNext to Panama Studio you can't pass indifferently! Their blankets, pillow cases and towels are must have!\nMr. Andrzej is a hero from Włókiennicza in Łódź. He took matters into his own hands and cares about the tenement house and neighbors!"

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

See it from the inside - corridors, cash registers and descent to the platforms.\nClick on the photos above to see the gallery from the new Łódź Kaliska station.\nThe beginning of Łódź Kaliskas reed in 1898. When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

Flats and a hotel will be built in Famuły at Ogrodowa 26 and 28 in Łódź. Everything in a style that combines industrial history with modernity.\nA few months ago, the city of Łódź sold the entire building complex (at Ogrodowa 26, 26a and 28, as well as Gdańska 3a and 3b and Mielczarski) for almost PLN 39 million. The new owner is the Arche Group known on the market - an investor with experience in saving monuments to live. In Łódź, this company already has success - the revitalization of the former cigarette factory, which today functions as a Hotel Tobaco.\nThe buildings at Ogrodowa in Łódź are almost 150 years old. They were created in stages from 1879, as workers' houses for employees of the Poznań factory. Although today they are in poor technical condition, they have retained their workborn character. Each building has an entry in the register of monuments, which means that the investor must work closely with the conservator in planning and implementation of renovation.\nThe Arche group does not intend to change the spirit of this place. The works are to last a maximum of five years and end with general modernization of Famuł. Design and arrangements are already underway. There are not only new apartments and a hotel, but also IParking service spaces. The whole is to create an attractive, multi -functional space in the vicinity of Manufaktura. The investment perfectly fits into the transformation of this part of the city - in recent years nearby streets have been revitalized, new investments have been created and the quality of public space has changed.\n>> The rest of the text is below <<\nAlso asfamuł at ul. Ogrodowa 24, a monumental building opposite the manufacture, undergoes a metamorphosis, which complements the Municipal Revitalization Program. Famuła will be ready to receive tenants and guests at the beginning of 2026. Now it is time for Famuły to get their second life at Ogrodowa 26 and 28 - the last missing element of this puzzle.\nIt is worth adding that it is on Friday, June 13 that the Arche group organizes the III Revitalization Forum in Łódź. The public is at the Tobaco Hotel and is devoted to the protection of monuments. This is not only an opportunity to talk about the future of Famuł, but also about how to save heritage that disappears from our cities. Arche argues that revitalization is not only an investment - it is a mission that combines history with the future.\nModern standards in city apartments in Łódź.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź.

    "content": "13/06/20257: 03 Koninicula\nDo you dream of healthy, aromatic vegetables straight from the bed? Own vegetable garden is not only a way for tasty and valuable food, but also a great form of relaxation and contact with nature. We advise on how to put on a home vegetable garden, what plants to choose and how to care for them to enjoy the taste of your own vegetables throughout the season.\nIn early spring comes the perfect moment to set up a vegetable garden. It is worth starting preparations - check the soil reaction, dig the beds, remove weeds and use organic fertilizers or green fertilizers. They will provide soil with valuable nutrients necessary for the growth of young plants.\nIn Poland's climatic conditions, both vegetables resistant to low temperatures and thermophilic ones, which we sow only after frosts, should be planted. The former include Carrots, radish, lettuce, parsley or spinach. Some vegetables, such as root celery or cocktail tomatoes, should be prepared in advance in the form of seedlings - thanks to this we will get crops faster.\nWhen setting up your own garden, plan the placement of plants well in such a way as to use the space as effectively as possible and provide individual vegetables with appropriate growth conditions. It is also important to avoid the neighborhood of large trees that can take the light and nutrients from plants through their extensive root system.\nThe cultivation of vegetables can be carried out almost throughout the entire growing season, and some plants - like perennial vegetables - will remain in our garden even in winter. Depending on the type, their care should be adapted to the needs - most vegetables require regular watering, which is best carried out in the morning or evening. An irreplaceable midfielder will be a good quality garden, which will allow you to quickly and precisely irrigate the flower beds.\nThermophilic vegetables, such as green beans, need more sun and protect from the wind. A great solution can be a garden pitch, which extends the growing season and allows you to sow the seeds directly into the ground. Thanks to it, you can grow vegetables even in less favorable weather conditions.\nIn care, you should not forget about mineral fertilizers - used in moderation, support plants, supplementing the deficiencies of microelements in the soil. It is worth remembering, however, that the soil conditions in our garden change over time, which is why regular observation of plants and their reaction to fertilization allows you to optimize crops.\nWhen choosing vegetables for your own vegetable garden, it is worth to be guided not only by their taste, but also with the ease of cultivation and the length of the growing season. Radish, carrots, beetroot or lettuce are easy to grow vegetables, which can be successfully planted at the beginning of the season. Root celery and white cabbage require more attention, but offer a unique taste and nutritional values.\nIn the home garden, there should also be space for ornamental plants, which perform not only an aesthetic but also practical function - they can deter some pests or attract pollinating insects. By planting vegetables next to flowers, we create a harmonious, healthy space that pleases the eye and gives crops.\nRemember that your own vegetables are a source of healthy nutrients, and a home garden is a great space for learning and relaxing - also for children. Their involvement in planting and collecting crops from a vegetable garden can be the beginning of a beautiful adventure with gardening."

Travel insurance is the basis, regardless of whether you are going on a short trip to Berlin or a monthly trip to Thailand.\nThe European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is a document that confirms our right to use the necessary health services during a temporary stay in other Member States of the European Union and Inseland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\nWhat does this mean in practice? If you break your leg during the holidays, with the EHIC card you will receive the necessary medical assistance on the same terms as a Spanish citizen. Remember, however, that healthcare systems differ between countries - in some countries many services are paid or requires co -payment of the patient, even if you are insured.\nThe EHIC will not cover, for example, the costs of medical transport to Poland or private healthcare, which is why in many situations it turns out to be a vacation insurance that you can buy yourself. It is available in various variants.\nSituations in which it is especially worth choosing tourist insurance are:\n● Planning active recreation, such as skiing or water sports. The costs of rescue operations in the mountains or at sea can be astronomical and are not covered by the EHIC card.\n● A trip to countries where medical care is expensive even in public institutions (e.g. France, Switzerland), basic protection may not be enough in the case of more serious health problems.\nTourist insurance will help you additionally secure your luggage, and also ensure reimbursement if, for example, the flight is canceled.\nThis type of policy provides more comprehensive protection during the trip and will allow you to fully use the trip, without worrying about the potential costs associated with various types of events. Both in the case of traveling in Europe and outside, such protection will prove to be extremely valuable.\nInsurance for trips outside Europe usually offer higher sums of treatment costs, which is necessary due to higher prices of medical services, especially in countries such as the USA, Canada, Japan or Australia.\nThey can also include such elements, elements as insurance against tropical diseases or bites by dangerous animals that we will not find in standard insurance for European trips.\nHowever, it is crucial to choose a policy that fully meets our needs and is tailored to the specifics of travel. It takes into account all potential risks related to the expedition and guarantees good preparation."

All thanks to the National Review of the Youth Dziatwa Theater - one of the oldest and most prestigious theater festivals for children and youth in Poland. The event is hosted by the Municipal Culture Zone, and the integration and workshop part will take place at the \"Słoneczna Polana\" center in Grotniki.\nDziatwa is a festival of a unique character - its history dates back to the 70s, and from the beginning the mission was to present and support the activities of children's and youth theaters from all over Poland. The event combines the function of a theater competition with the educational platform and space for building the environment of instructors and young artists.\nDuring three days, participants will take part in competition shows of performances that will take place in the Municipal Cultural Zone: Żubardź at ul. Żubardzka 3. Theater presentations will end with sessions of discussions conducted by jurors and theater experts - this is a characteristic element of children, emphasizing the value of reflection, constructive criticism and artistic development.\nAn important aspect of the review are also numerous thematic workshops, planned for both participants and their carers:\n\"We write reality - a creative story workshop\" will be led by Michał Malinowski - a well -known story story and a word animator of the word;\n\"Words that live - an introduction to a living word to culture\" - classes with Adam Mortas aimed at working with the text, its interpretation and expression;\n\"I breathe and say - the magic of breath on stage\" - a workshop in the field of voice emission and work with the body, led by Piotr Osak;\nA special session for instructors: \"Process work in the theater - methodology of building a performance\", led by an experienced teacher of the Wiktor Moraczewski Theater.\nIn addition, an author's meeting with Agnieszka Frączek is planned - a valued author of children's and youth literature, known for linguistic sensitivity and ability to move the imagination of young readers.\nAn integral part of the event is also the integration part, taking place in the picturesque environment of Grotnik, in the festival town. A bonfire, joint evenings and outdoor workshops are moments that build a sense of community and friendships going beyond theatrical boards.\nThe culmination of the review will be the final of the 46th edition of the Dziatwa, which will take place on June 18 at 16:15 in MSK: Żubardź. Then we will meet the winners, but as every year, the most important will be not competition, but the experience, meeting and theater understood as a space for creating and telling the world.\nFor more information, please visit www.msk.lodz.pl.\nKylie Minogue in Atlas Arena.

Everyone who wants to share such things - used, but still in good condition or new ones can join the action.\nEspecially desirable are water bottles and water bottles, which are made of solid material (e.g. stainless steel or plastic), tight, with a capacity of at least 500 ml and easy to clean (so that washing does not require the use of special, additional brushes). In turn, backpacks and bags should be light, but solid, roomy (preferably with many pockets for easier arrangement of all things inside), waterproof or at least resistant to moisture and closed with a zipper or other types of protection protecting against theft or loss of items hidden in the inside.\nEager who are in possession of excess water bottles, water bottles, backpacks and bags (clean and undamaged) are asked to bring them from Monday to Friday from 9-15 to the headquarters of the Faculty of Supporting People in the crisis of homelessness at ul. Objazdowa 17.\nAt the same time, streetworkers are collecting men's summer clothing for people in the crisis of homelessness. Summer jackets, pants, sweatshirts and men's shoes are particularly sought after. Clothes should be undamaged and in a state \"ready to be put\" (i.e. not requiring laundry). It is very important that it is sportswear, which we would packed in the backpack, going on a trip and in the state we would like to put it in. Elegant suit pants or varnished shoes will certainly not be useful for people in the crisis of homelessness.\nŁódź helps start-ups. Join the Startups Powered by Invest in Łódź program\nSmile!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź.

The city is more and more boldly focusing on green solutions in construction, which will translate not only into lower bills for tenants, but also into better air quality and comfort of life.\nWhen building new city apartments in Łódź, the future was thought of, which is why investments were focused on renewable energy sources, green roofs, water retention and ecological materials.\nExample? Building at ul. Nawrot 98 in Łódź, whose construction is currently underway. 35 apartments will be built there, of which 17 will join the city resource. The building will be modern, and a green roof will be built over the underground garage for 24 cars. This is not only an aesthetic element, but also a practical solution - vegetation on the roof improves the microclimate, helps cleanse the air and limits the effect of the so -called urban heat island. The investment is implemented jointly by the city of Łódź and WTBS, with funding from the government subsidy fund.\nEven more advanced green technologies will appear at ul. Skierniewicka 8/10 in Łódź. Thanks to the funds from the national reconstruction plan (KPO), 36 new city apartments will be built there, and the whole building will be almost self -sufficient.\nThey will be there:\nThis will make the inhabitants pay less for heating and electricity, and the building will be much less issue. This investment is also a joint project of Łódź and WTBS. Construction is to start in the near future.\nTwo more housing investments in Łódź will also be modern and fast in construction. At ul. Pabianicka 5/13 as many as 153 city apartments will be built, and at ul. Młynarska 20 in Bałuty - another 28.\nWhat will make them stand out? The buildings will be built in prefabricated technology, which not only reduces construction time, but also significantly reduces the amount of waste and energy consumed at the construction site. Prefabricates are also a guarantee of better thermal insulation and smaller energy losses.\nBut that's not all at ul. Pabianicka in Łódź is planned a number of eco solutions. The installation of photovoltaic panels that provide energy to common parts will be installed on the roof, which means savings on electricity bills. There will also be plantings, and excess rainwater will be collected in retention tanks. The building will create green roofs that will not only ensure aesthetic appearance, additional air purification and oxygen production, but also create a microclimate that will limit the effect of the heat island and will be thermal insulation for the building.\nA BMS building management system will be installed both at Pabianicka and Młynarska. This means automatic control of the building's technical functions. The task of BMS automation is to integrate installations occurring on the facility. The building automation system binds all systems into one whole, which allows you to manage the entire object from one place efficiently and in an economical way.\nStart of both investments soon!\nImportantly, green solutions will become a standard in all new municipal buildings. Soon, further ecological elements will be used as part of the new stage of area revitalization of the Center of Łódź, it is about the area limited by the streets: Próchnika, Revolution of 1905, Wschodnia, Jaracz, Kiliński, Narutowicz, Zielona, ​​West and areas directly adjacent to this quarter.\nThey will be there:\nThe city's goal is not only to increase the comfort of life of the inhabitants, but also to achieve climate neutrality. In practice, this means energy -saving buildings that consume much less energy and are more environmentally friendly.\nFurther famules at Ogrodowa in Łódź for revitalization.

About 100 people are needed to run trams. What conditions should be met and how much can you earn in this position?\nYou don't have to be able to go by tram to get a job. Everything can be learned during special courses organized by the Motor MotorMPK Łódź Training Center. Importantly, they are free. After their completion, the candidate only undertakes to work three years as a driver.\nSince the course lasts several weeks, which for the most part would be a fairly long period without remuneration, MPK Łódź offers employment during the training. The duties of such employees, in addition to participating in classes, it is practical to learn about the functioning of the depot, which will be useful in later work.\nWhere is the hook? Not everyone can become a driver. This is a very demanding and responsible work. To be able to carry passengers, you need to undergo a several -stage recruitment process.\nThe recruitment process consists of several stages. The first is the written test of professional predispositions. Then the interview is held. The third stage is medical and psychological examinations. If the candidate passes all stages positively, he is directed to a course that lasts about 7 weeks. It ends with a state exam conducted by the Provincial Road Traffic Center in Łódź.\nThe candidate for Motorowiczgk Łódźmusi is to be at least 21 years old, well as if he had a category B driving license and professional experience - especially in shift and night work. Psychophysical fitness is also very important. Future motorists should be characterized by punctuality, responsibility, ability to act in stress conditions, calmness, self -control, as well as the ability to concentrate and focus attention.\nThe remuneration of the leaders depends on the internship and the number of hours worked. The average salary of motorists (together with bonuses and additions) is about PLN 9,200 gross. A person who is just starting to work in this position can count on a salary of approx. PLN 7,800 gross, which \"on hand\" gives about PLN 5,500.\nIn addition, MPK Łódź offers its employees: an employment contract, free training, children's leave and rest co -financing, employee loans and free psychologist care.\nDetailed information at: www.mpk.lodz.pl/praca.\nHow many millionaires live in Łódź?

Only the acceptance of councilors will allow this intention to be realized. The local spatial development plan provides for the use of a plot under \"Demided green areas\". The specialty allows the MPZP entries to circumvent, but the consent of the local government is necessary.\nThe conceptual design of the residential residential building is set up by a single building with an internal courtyard at the height of the first floor (on the ground floor ceiling). The building is characterized by an original facade, which in the designers' intention is to be a frame and background for the richness of the investment (hence its name: \"Zabama\"). It is to be Greenery (also trees) in pots on the terraces, on mesh filling the spaces of the openwork facade, as well as a green roof with planting grass and shrubs. The supply of vegetation with water will be provided by an irrigation installation, which is an element covering the entire investment of the rainwater retention system - with a reservoir storage in the basement.\nInterestingly, on some visualizations illustrating the concept design of the building, the planned greenery was intentionally removed - this is to serve better readability of architecture, as the authors explain. And if someone \"take\" the facade brings to mind the front facade of the \"Słoneczne Tarasy\" investment at ul. Kilińskiego 12 in Łódź, it is not in this case.

    "content": "11.06.202521: 36 Milosze Wika\nWierzbowa Street in Łódź is slowly turning into a gallery of murals. Recently, the sixth mural has appeared there. It was created on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the establishment of the Waterworks and Sewage Plant in Łódź.\nThe new mural on Wierzbowa Street in Łódź is dedicated to engineer Stefan Skrzywan -the first director of the sewage and water supply department of the city of Łódź. He was the originator of the inscription \"Smile\", which he ordered to place at the entrance to the pre -war headquarters of ZWiK at Narutowicza Street 65 in Łódź.\nThe block of this building was designed in the modernist style by Wiesław Lisowski - one of the most famous architects of pre -war Łódź. The construction was completed in 1929.  In the hall, in front of the front door, the Skrzywan engineer ordered to arrange a mosaic of tiny stone tiles, creating the inscription \"Smile\". It was his life motto - for trouble and bad mood, the best medicine is a smile. That's how he wanted to welcome his subordinates, who struggled with the hardships of building sewage and sewage treatment plants every day. This is how he wanted to welcome the residents of Łódź who visited the seat of the sewage and water supply of the city of Łódź.\nDuring World War II, the mosaic was destroyed. Only the letters of the \"UŚ\" remained. After the war, the building became the property of the University of Lodz. In 2009, the authorities of ZWiK Łódź, together with the rector of the University of Lodz, decided to renew it. And so familiar inscription again welcomes students, employees and guests of the university, reminding that a smile is the most important in life!\n>> The rest of the text is below <<\nThe new mural \"Smile\" on the facade of the current headquarters of ZWiK Łódź at 52 Wierzbowa Street resembles the motto of engineer Stefan Skrzywan, goes out with him \"onto the street\", to the residents. The mural is modeled on the original from the pre -war headquarters of ZWiK Łódź. The graphic motif present in the background also comes from a historic mosaic in the building at Narutowicza 65. The jubilee mural was made by the Łódź artist Tomasz Jędrczak. The work is presented next to another mural on which we see the first builders of Łódź channels from 100 years ago.\nEngineer Stefan Skrzywan 100 years ago undertook a very difficult task - saving Łódź from a sanitary catastrophe. The city of 600,000 at the time did not have sewage and water supply, impurities from factories and houses went straight to the streets and local rivers. There was a lack of water - both for residents and the necessary fibrous plants. Thanks to the determination of the boxing from the center of Łódź, the stinking gutters disappeared, he managed to channel almost the entire Śródmieście Łódź and launch the first mechanical sewage treatment plant in Lublinek, although from the beginning he was struggling with the most serious obstacle - the lack of financial resources.\nHe did not give up, sought money for the construction of sewage system, water supply and drilling the first city deep wells. He was a special man: energetic, hard -working, well -organized and positive about people. His cheerful character, commitment to work for the city and residents were appreciated by all his colleagues.\nHow did Norlaban disappear?

See it from the inside - corridors, cash registers and descent to the platforms.\nClick on the photos above to see the gallery from the new Łódź Kaliska station.\nThe beginning of Łódź Kaliskas reed in 1898. When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź.

The road to the creation of the first legalized singing society in Łódź was of particular importance, and led through the secretly working Polish choirs.\nAround 1890, a group of choral singing enthusiasts organized an association modeled on the Warsaw \"Lutnia\". The founders were, among others Well -known photographer Bronisław Wilkoszewski, writer Stefan Krzyszkowski or bookseller Gustaw Gebethner. When in 1892 the Łódź \"Lutnia\" was registered, 40 people belonged to her. The choir directors were Stanisław Niedzielski, Alojzy Dworzaczek, and then Kazimierz Danysz. Already in September 1892, the first concert for children was held in the Thalia Theater Hall.\nIn 1894, \"Lutnia\" was based in the Resursa hall in the Grand Hotel, five years later a building was rented in the outbuilding at ul. Piotrkowska 108. On the ground floor a room for 200 people, a reading room and billiards, was arranged, there was a concert and play room with a balcony for the orchestra.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

What will happen next?\nAfter an uneven but successful season, the Widzewa Łódź team must be created again. A year ago there was a lot of staff exchange, but several key players were stopped. This time it was different. At ul. Małachowski will no longer be played by Kamil Kucharski or Kamil Izbiański, other colors will also be defended by Adrian Ramirez, Arkadiusz Szypczyński, Filip Vaktor, Eric Sylla and Aaro Pappenen.\nThe composition for the next season must therefore be built completely again. This process is already underway, and the first new face is Dima Ribitskyi. However, this task will not be easy. The whole league took a few steps forward, and the money that the players want to earn have increased significantly. Unfortunately, Widzewa's budget did not follow it. So if you fail to find a rich sponsor, the staff can be much weaker than those we have watched in previous years.\nSMS Łódź is a forge of talents.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets.

Famous artists came to Łódź massively for photos and resided in hotels in Łódź, especially in the Grand Hotel.\n>> The rest of the text is below <<\nThe second impulse of the liberation of the film potential of the city was probably the establishment in Łódź in 1948, the Film School, i.e. the famous \"Film\", which had various names, and finally it works as today as the State Film, Television and Teatralna School. Leon Schiller. The university known all over the world has become a legend, synonym of prestige, creativity and quality of education. Outstanding actors, directors, operators, screenwriters, animation specialists and production managers passed through the walls of the Film School at ul. Targowa 61/63, which for years strengthened the position of the capital of Polish cinema. Careers have become a myth, including Andrzej Wajda, Krzysztof Zanussi, Krzysztof Kieślowski or Jerzy Skolimowski and many excellent operators. This is a very strong film accent on an international scale and one of the main bastions of Hollyłódź - as our city later called Jan Machulski.\nSee also: Culture in Łódź in the 70s The Grand Theater, Operetta Łódź and Cinema\nThe Educational Film Factory in Łódź was one of the largest producers of short school, popular science and natural films in the country, documentary paintings, as well as series and short feature forms.

They realized here, among others Włodzimierz Puchalski, Jacek Bławut and Maciej Drygas, and the leading creators of Polish cinematography also began their careers here, including Wojciech Jerzy Has, Krzysztof Zanussi, Marek Koterski, Jan Machulski and Jerzy Kolski as well as operators Paweł Edelman, Zbigniew Rybczyński and Paweł Sobociński. \"Educational\", unlike the WFF, happily survived in a residual form, trying to keep valuable harvest.\nThis is not the end of the then film boat potential. It also housed the SE-MA-For Studio. Over 1,400 animated films were created here, mainly with cycles of iconic children's fairy tales with a teddy bear, presented by decades on television. In addition, from 1952 Łódź Film Copies operated, from 1955 - a film studio studio, and then also a branch of the National Filmoteka. If we add a record number of 35 cinemas in the country, it could be said that the inhabitants of Łódź loved cinema and the cinematography loved Łódź.

This is only part of the support that 85-year-old Liliana Bellerman from Dąbrowa in Łódź receives from his neighbor-72-year-old Danuta Tomczyk. Ladies are one of 75 pairs of neighbors using neighborly services, implemented by the Municipal Social Welfare Center in Łódź.\nNeighborly services provided by a neighbor consist in: help and support in meeting the basic needs at the place of residence of the mentee (e.g. shopping, preparing meals, cleaning the apartment), basic hygiene and care care, assistance in providing contacts with the environment and support in dealing with small official matters. This kind of support is addressed to lonely people who, due to age, illness or other causes, require the help of other people, and whose family is not able to provide such help.\nWe live with Danusia in the same cage in the block probably from 50 years. I on the first floor and she on the fourth. I am lonely and I am getting worse with everyday duties, and Danusia has been helping me for about 13 years. I learned that this year we can use neighborly services so that Danusia receives at least a partial salary for supporting me. So we reported to MOPS in Łódź and arranged all the formalities. This help of Danusia is wonderful. I can't imagine using the support of a completely unknown babysitter. Danusia will always look at me when she goes to a housing estate and asked if I don't need something. He knows perfectly in which bakery is this bread for diabetics that I like the most. It's really wonderful, irreplaceable help - says Mrs. Liliana Bellerman.\nMOPS in Łódź provides neighborly services as part of two projects with EU funding: \"Helpful hand - development of social services for the inhabitants of Łódź\" and \"Social services for the Łódź metropolitan area\". In total, by the end of 2027, 420 pairs of neighbors living in Łódź can use them.\n>> The rest of the text is below <\nDo you want to use neighborly services? It's not difficult! Report to one of the three environmental work departments of Łódź MOPS:\nOr fill out the form available at www.mops.lodz.pl, in the \"EU projects\" tab.\nDuring the notification, you should indicate a neighbor - a guardian who must live nearby, be of legal age and not be a member of a senior family whose help will be provided. A helping neighbor must present a certificate confirming the completion of first aid training or take part in training organized by MOPS in Łódź. The next date of such training is Thursday, June 26, 2025.\nThe maximum dimension of neighborly aid is 24 hours a month. For his support, the helping neighbor receives a salary of PLN 800 gross per month (in the case of a full number of hours). In turn, a neighbor using help bears a partial payment of 10% of the total cost of the service, i.e. a maximum of PLN 80 per month.\nEnd of the year at the University of the Third Age of the University of Lodz.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

There was a draw on the pitch, so it must mean a rematch!\n>> Pictures from the Stars match in Łódź can be found in the gallery above! <<\nDespite the rainy aura, football fans in Łódź were gathering from the very morning. First on the Manufaktura market, where they met with, among others, Grzegorz Krychowiak and Zbigniew Boniek. Then everything moved to the football theater. At 16:00 the match of stars in Łódź opened Blanka with her performance, and then everything in her own hands, and basically the legs, was taken by footballers.\nThe beginning definitely belonged to Poles. Sławomir Peszko was very active. In the middle of the field, the duo Krychowiak-Świerczewski conducted well. The legendary Zbigniew Boniek also collected his minutes. It was the white and red that opened the result, Krychowiak played to Peszka, and he defeated Jens Lehmann with a certain shot. Unfortunately, just before the break, the French leveled. After changing sides, the Tri -color started to attack, but Rafał Gikiewicz did a great job. The end could belong to the hosts, Quebo had a great situation, but there was a bit of luck.\nThe draw reflects very well what was happening on the pitch. The spontaneous doping meant that the players gave literally everything. The cup stayed in Poland, but now both teams arranged for next year's rematch.\nŁKS Coolpack Łódź discovers cards.

Adam Widerski, a teacher from Łódź, won the hearts of readers with a series of detective stories embedded in the realities of his hometown. His novels are not only a dynamic action and complex intrigues, but also a tribute to the forgotten corners of Łódź.\nEvery day he is a teacher in three primary schools in Łódź. Teaches history and WOS. Working with young people teaches him humility and patience, but also gives great satisfaction. In the evenings, when he finishes his school duties, he sits on a computer to create dark stories with a boat in the background. He became a writer by accident.\nThe idea to write my debut entitled \"Refretion\" was born from rebellion towards duplicated patterns. I had enough superheroes in uniforms, addicted to stimulants and indestructible. I wanted heroes of flesh and blood - people with defects, traumas, but also determination - says Adam Widerski.\nThis is how the duo was born: Piotr Majski and Łukasz Krzyski - heroes who today have a number of loyal fans.\nThe cycle with commissioners Majski and Krzyski developed in subsequent volumes: \"Prophecy\" and the latest \"Reverse\".\nI want the reader not to guess the murderer until the last page. I try to lead the intrigue to surprise all the time - emphasizes the author. In the \"reverse\", the reputation of the investigator suspected of murder and forced to escape is becoming a stake.\nIn addition to the continuation of the cycle, Adam also created two separate detective stories: \"Schnyta\" and \"Tourist\".  In these books he allowed himself more experiments. He focused on character psychology and on the atmosphere: dark, disturbing, sometimes even stuffy. His novels are multi -threaded, dynamic and full of details.\nI don't create simple stories. I like to multiply threads, confuse the clues, but also give the reader something more: emotions, reflection, sometimes even anxiety - he explains.\nAnd where could I put the action if not in Łódź? I am a blood and blood Łódź. This is my city. I know them, I love and want to show that it can be as intriguing as Warsaw or Wrocław - says Adam, for whom Łódź is not only a background, but also a full hero of his story.\n>> The rest of the text is below <<\nStreets, tenements, city history. It all plays his first violin. The detective story does not have to happen in the metropolis with a view of the sea. - It can happen here, next to Gdańsk and Piotrkowska - he explains, and local patriotism and passion for history give his books a unique atmosphere.\nIn addition to writing a novel, Adam shares his knowledge by conducting creative writing workshops, mainly for teachers.\nI was surprised how great the need to create among my colleagues. Classes have a thoughtful structure: theory, practice and homework. Effect? Participants go out with a ready plan of the novel, and some are already writing - he says.\nAdam also runs the blog \"Get caught to a book\", active mainly on social media. This is where he reviews, recommends reading and talks to other authors and readers. He treats close contact with the recipients as an important element of writing.\nIn the latest novel \"Reverse\" author shows that even favorite heroes can \"trip\". The story begins with the happy engagement of Commissioner Piotr Krzyski, who a moment later is accused of murdering a colleague from work. With each chapter, the plot thickens, and the clues begin to lead to completely unexpected directions. This is a story about a thin border between truth and appearance.\nArt is available to everyone.

See it from the inside - corridors, cash registers and descent to the platforms.\nClick on the photos above to see the gallery from the new Łódź Kaliska station.\nThe beginning of Łódź Kaliskas reed in 1898. When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź.

The animal was born on July 1, 2024 in the Zoological Garden in Czech Děčín and reached Łódź on May 28.\nTri-colored squirrel is a species derived from the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. His hallmark is an extremely effective coloration: the deep black of the back contrasts with the fire with the red side of the body and the snow -white belly. This bright contrast has a masking function in a natural environment - in a shadow tropical forest, these colors blend with the surroundings like a natural camouflage.\nThe new resident of the Orientarium Zoo Łódź is fast, agile and very curious - almost immediately after arrival he began exploring the new environment. He is currently in the aviary at the monkey grove, but he plans to move to space in the vicinity of the mini zoo, where he will gain more space for climbing and jumping.\nIt is worth adding that three -colored squirrels, although they are not currently threatened with extinction, are increasingly falling victim to illegal trade and loss of habitats as a result of deforestation.

Thanks to almost 459 thousand PLN co -financing from the Municipal Program Special Revitalization Zone will be renovated the front facade of the building and balconies. This is an important step towards restoring this unique object of its former splendor and emphasizing its architectural value.\nThe tenement house, erected in 1936 for the brothers David and Lejba Klajman, owners of the textile factory factory, is one of the best examples of modernism in Łódź. Designed by architect Witold Szereszewski, he is distinguished by a simple, symmetrical facade, varied by two pionemibalconal and characteristic vertical lane of windows illuminating the staircase. The front facade was lined with polished granite plates on the ground floor and sandstone on the upper floors, which gives the building an elegant look.\nAfter the world war, the man was taken over by the state, and its original owners expropriated. One of the buildings standing deep in the plot (Kościuszko 54) housed a common room for policemen, and later a kindergarten. Among the well -known residents of the tenement house was, among others Choreographer and dancer Feliks Parnell and Józef Niewiadomski, president of Łódź in 1978–1985.\nThe renovation of the facade (from the first floor) has just begun with the renovation of the balconies. Podcepras Kościuszki 56 are possible thanks to the support from the Municipal Special Revitalization Zone. Since its launch in 2017, Łódź has already donated over PLN 24 million, which allowed 110 renovations in 77 tenements. The effects can be seen with the naked eye - the renovated facades are eye -catching.\nIf you are the owner or live in a historic building in Śródmieście, it is worth following subsequent SSR recruitments.

    "content": "[Translation Error] 06.06.20258:07ARTYKUŁ SPONSOROWANY\nWynajem samochodu to wygodne rozwiązanie dla wielu osób, jednak, aby uniknąć dodatkowych kosztów czy problemów prawnych, warto znać zasady, których musimy przestrzegać. W artykule znajdziesz informacje o tym, czego nie wolno robić w samochodzie z wypożyczalni, by cieszyć się bezproblemową jazdą i uniknąć niepotrzebnych kłopotów.\nUmowa najmu samochodu to dokument, który określa wszelkie warunki użytkowania pojazdu. Ważne jest, aby dokładnie zapoznać się z jej treścią. Nieprzestrzeganie warunków, takich jak limit kilometrów czy zasady parkowania, może skutkować dodatkowymi opłatami. Obejmuje to również zakaz używania samochodu do celów komercyjnych, takich jak przewóz osób za opłatą, jeśli nie jest to wyraźnie dozwolone.\nUżytkowanie samochodu z wypożyczalni nie zwalnia z obowiązku znajomości przepisów prawnych, które regulują jego eksploatację. Ignorowanie przepisów ruchu drogowego, takich jak nadmierna prędkość, prowadzenie pojazdu pod wpływem alkoholu czy narkotyków, czy też łamanie zakazu korzystania z telefonu podczas jazdy, może prowadzić do poważnych konsekwencji.\nWiększość wypożyczalni samochodów stanowczo zakazuje palenia w wynajmowanych pojazdach. Powód jest prosty – zapach dymu tytoniowego trudno usunąć, co dyskwalifikuje samochód z ponownego wynajmu na dłuższy czas. Palenie w aucie z wypożyczalni może wiązać się z sankcjami finansowymi na pokrycie kosztów czyszczenia.\nZakaz palenia tytoniu obowiązuje również w kontekście innych substancji, takich jak marihuana. Chociaż posiadanie marihuany jest legalne w niektórych miejscach, jej palenie w samochodzie z wypożyczalni może skutkować podobnymi konsekwencjami, jak w przypadku tytoniu.\nPrzewożenie zwierząt w samochodzie z wypożyczalni może nie być zabronione, aczkolwiek zazwyczaj wymaga zachowania odpowiednich środków ostrożności, takich jak używanie klatek transportowych. Nieprzewidziane zabrudzenie wnętrza pojazdu może prowadzić do dodatkowych opłat za jego czyszczenie.\nTransportowanie materiałów niebezpiecznych, takich jak chemikalia, łatwopalne substancje, czy broń, jest absolutnie zabronione. Wiąże się to nie tylko z potencjalnym ryzykiem dla kierowcy i pasażerów, ale również z konsekwencjami prawnymi.\nSamochód wynajmowany z wypożyczalni nie jest własnością osoby wynajmującej, w związku z czym wszelkie modyfikacje są zabronione. Obejmuje to zarówno zmiany w wyglądzie zewnętrznym, takie jak naklejanie naklejek, plakatów czy zmiana koloru, jak i modyfikacje wnętrza.\nPodobnie jak w przypadku zmian wizualnych, modyfikacje dotyczące instalacji technicznych, takich jak montaż dodatkowego sprzętu czy systemów elektronicznych, są surowo zabronione. Tego typu działania mogą prowadzić do uszkodzenia pojazdu, a co za tym idzie – wysokich kosztów naprawy.\nParkowanie w miejscach, gdzie jest to zabronione, może prowadzić do mandatów oraz dodatkowych opłat związanych z odholowaniem pojazdu. Wypożyczalnia może naliczyć dodatkowe opłaty administracyjne za zarządzanie takimi sprawami.\nBrak zabezpieczenia samochodu, takiego jak zamknięcie drzwi czy pozostawienie wartościowych przedmiotów na widoku, może prowadzić do kradzieży lub uszkodzenia pojazdu. W przypadku kradzieży lub uszkodzenia na skutek nieuwagi, osoba wynajmująca ponosi odpowiedzialność finansową.\nWynajmując samochód, zazwyczaj tylko osoba podpisująca umowę jest autoryzowana do jego prowadzenia. Przekazanie kluczyków osobie trzeciej, która nie została uwzględniona w umowie, może skutkować utratą ubezpieczenia oraz koniecznością pokrycia kosztów ewentualnych szkód.\nPozwolenie na prowadzenie samochodu przez osobę, która nie posiada odpowiednich uprawnień do kierowania pojazdem, jest zabronione. W przypadku jakiejkolwiek kolizji czy incydentu, koszty i odpowiedzialność będą spoczywały na osobie wynajmującej.\nNadmierna prędkość to jedno z najczęstszych wykroczeń na drodze, które może prowadzić do poważnych problemów prawnych, w tym mandatów i punktów karnych. Ponadto, wypożyczalnia może naliczyć dodatkowe opłaty za zarządzanie mandatami.\nWiele wypożyczalni wprowadza limit kilometrów, które można przejechać w ciągu doby lub całego okresu najmu. Przekroczenie tego limitu wiąże się z dodatkowymi opłatami, które mogą znacznie podwyższyć koszt wynajmu. Na szczęście na rynku istnieją wypożyczalnie, które nie nakładają takich limitów na swoich klientów. Jedną z nich jestCarFree, która posiada swoje oddziały w całej Polsce w tym:\nNie, większość wypożyczalni samochodów zakazuje palenia w wynajmowanych pojazdach. Palenie może prowadzić do dodatkowych opłat za czyszczenie.\nTak, ale zazwyczaj wymaga to zastosowania odpowiednich środków ostrożności, takich jak użycie klatek transportowych, aby uniknąć dodatkowych opłat za czyszczenie wnętrza pojazdu.\nNie, chyba że ta osoba jest uwzględniona w umowie najmu. W przeciwnym razie możesz stracić ubezpieczenie i być odpowiedzialnym za wszelkie szkody.\nPrzekroczenie limitu kilometrów określonego w umowie najmu wiąże się z dodatkowymi opłatami. Zawsze warto to sprawdzić przed podpisaniem umowy.\nNie, wszelkie modyfikacje samochodu, zarówno wizualne jak i techniczne, są zabronione. Mogą one prowadzić do uszkodzenia pojazdu i wysokich kosztów naprawy."

See it from the inside - corridors, cash registers and descent to the platforms.\nClick on the photos above to see the gallery from the new Łódź Kaliska station.\nThe beginning of Łódź Kaliskas reed in 1898. When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

    "content": "05.06.202519: 07as\nŁódź does not look away from people in the crisis of homelessness. On the contrary - the city is starting with the largest support program, worth nearly PLN 11 million. This is the first such large initiative in Łódź, financed from external funds and implemented jointly with as many as five non -governmental organizations, the Municipal Social Welfare Center in Łódź and the Revitalization Office as a leader.\nThe aim of the project is to help people who have been living in public space for years - in the streets, in parks, in vacancy. Residents of social housing and people using shelters, hostels or lodging house will also receive support.\nThis project is a breakthrough. Łódź says clearly: each person deserves a chance and dignified life. It is not enough to give someone a roof over his head, you must also help him return to society - says Sławomir Granatowski, director of the Revitalization Office of the Medical University.\nSpecialist support for people in the crisis of homelessness in Łódź will be granted, among others by streetworkers. MOPS Łódź currently employs 6 streetworkers working both in the field and stationary in the Department of Supporting People in the crisis of homelessness. Each of them has a different part of the city. As part of the project, 2 consecutive streetworkers will be employed, who will help the homeless from Widzewa and Bałut. Another 5 streetworkers will be employed by the Szczypta Dobra Association.\nStreetworkers will build relationships with people in the crisis of homelessness, gaining their trust and accompanying them in making decisions about change. Such work requires great commitment and patience, but often brings real results.\nEvery homeless who will be covered by the project will be able to count on comprehensive support of specialists in many fields - from a psychologist, psychotraumatologist, psychiatrist, therapist and psychotherapist of addiction by a social worker, a pedagogue and an environmental nurse to a professional advisor and a coach. There will also be a new, very important role - an expert through experience, i.e. a person who once experienced homelessness, and today helps others get out of the crisis.\nOne of the pillars of the project is 7 training apartments at ul. Pogonowskiego 34 intended for a total of 16 people. It is there that \"without a roof over their heads\" will be able not only to temporarily live, but also learn to live again - with the support of specialists, step by step, in a safe environment.\nThe second, innovative element is the implementation of the pilot model \"first apartment\". The city will provide 6 apartments-four 1-person and two 2-person-for people who have lived on the street for years. Instead of setting conditions (e.g. addiction treatment or finding a job), they will first get a stable place to live. Only then, with the help of a team of specialists, will they work on further changes. This approach, already proven in the Scandinavian and USA countries, and recognized as one of the most effective methods of ending homelessness, is to bring lasting results.\nThe \"First Apartment\" model is a revolutionary support model of people experiencing homelessness, which puts emphasis on ensuring a stable, own apartment as the first step to return to traditional life - says Kamila Smyczek, deputy director for environmental assistance MOPS in Łódź.\nAs part of the project, as many as 408 people will receive help, of which 56 will use the formula of assisted apartments or the \"FIRST FIRE\" program. The key will be an individual approach - each person will have a support plan developed, adapted to their situation and needs. The city and partners' own contribution will include both financial resources and the work of volunteers. The project will be implemented in 2025-2028, and its results are to be used as a base for further developing system support for people in the crisis of homelessness.\nPartner organizations that got involved in the undertaking are: Family Service Center, Caritas of the Archdiocese of Łódź, Society for the Aid. Saint. Brother Albert near Łódź, the Szczypta Dobra Association and the Sarepta Foundation.\nThanks to this initiative, Łódź has a chance to become a leader in the fight against homelessness in Poland - not by ad hoc actions, but by building lasting solutions based on trust, empathy and effective support.\nŁódź.

And what next\", in which the Dialogue Center looks at the post -war fate of those who managed to survive the Holocaust. He analyzes the challenge, which, in addition to relief, brought to millions of people the end of World War II. Salvated they had to find in the new world of changed borders, resettlement, political changes and the threat of a new world conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. These difficult changes fell into the traumatized and deeply experienced communities of all of Europe and the world, including European Jews.\nAnna Bikont's book is the first report that in such a comprehensive way looks at the fate of Polish Jews and Jewish women who survived the destruction and faced dramatic dilemmas: will you stay empty and hostility in a country, or try to start again somewhere else? Do you care for the identity that has contributed to their suffering or to hide it carefully?\nThe author recalls the extraordinary and moving images of post -war life: Jewish farmers in Lower Silesia giving the cows names in Yiddish, reconstruction of religious, political and cultural life, illegal attempts at emigration, collecting extermination testimonies, but also a sense of loneliness and the effort of the decision about the future. Admission to the event is free.\nCraft and Upcycling Fair in Łódź.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

    "content": "[Translation Error] 05.06.202511:35ARTYKUŁ SPONSOROWANY\nNaprawa auta często kojarzy się z dużymi wydatkami, które mogą poważnie obciążyć domowy budżet. Jednak nie musi tak być! Wystarczy skorzystać ze sprawdzonego źródła używanych części, które umożliwi skuteczną naprawę bez konieczności wydawania fortuny.\nCoraz więcej kierowców decyduje się nazakup części samochodowych z drugiej ręki, poszukując tańszych, lecz niezawodnych rozwiązań. Auto części pochodzące z demontażu stanowią świetną alternatywę dla nowych elementów – zwłaszcza przy intensywnym użytkowaniu i częstych naprawach. W tym artykule omówimy, na co zwracać uwagę wybierając części używane oraz gdzie szukać najlepszych komponentów.\nWielu kierowców obawia się, że części używane mogą być gorszej jakości lub szybko się zużyją. Tymczasem oryginalne elementy z demontażu, pozyskiwane od zaufanych dostawców, często przewyższają tanie zamienniki pod względem trwałości i idealnego dopasowania. Wybierając sprawdzone, używane części, możesz naprawić samochód tanio, jednocześnie mając pewność, że auto będzie działać bezpiecznie i niezawodnie. W praktyce odpowiednio dobrane części z drugiej ręki sprawdzają się równie dobrze jak nowe, zwłaszcza jeśli pochodzą z pewnego źródła i są dokładnie sprawdzane przed sprzedażą. Dla wielu kierowców to doskonały sposób na zmniejszenie kosztów eksploatacji pojazdu bez utraty jakości. Warto wiedzieć, na co zwrócić uwagę przy wyborze i kiedy taka opcja naprawdę się opłaca.\nNajwiększą zaletą części używanych jest ich atrakcyjna cena. Nowe podzespoły, zwłaszcza oryginalne części OEM, mogą kosztować nawet kilka razy więcej niż ich używane odpowiedniki. Dzięki temu wymiana elementów takich jak reflektory, moduły elektroniczne czy części zawieszenia staje się znacznie tańsza.Właściciele samochodów marek premium, takich jak BMW, Mercedes czy Audi, mają realną szansę na obniżenie kosztów serwisu nawet o połowę, bez utraty jakości. W praktyce oznacza to znaczące oszczędności, szczególnie przy bardziej skomplikowanych naprawach. Wybierając części z drugiej ręki, kierowcy mogą liczyć nie tylko na niższe koszty, ale również na idealne dopasowanie do konkretnego modelu auta. Używane części sprawdzają się w wielu sytuacjach – od prostych usterek po bardziej złożone awarie – pozwalając utrzymać samochód w dobrej kondycji bez nadmiernego obciążania portfela.\nUżywane części OEM pochodzące z demontażu zachowują wysokie standardy jakości, ponieważ zostały wyprodukowane zgodnie z wymaganiami fabrycznymi. W przeciwieństwie do tanich zamienników aftermarket, oryginalne elementy gwarantują lepsze dopasowanie i dłuższą żywotność. Wiele sklepów oferuje również gwarancję rozruchową, co zwiększa komfort i bezpieczeństwo użytkowania. Wybierając używane, oryginalne części samochodowe, masz pewność, że podzespoły spełniają rygorystyczne normy producentów i będą działać bezproblemowo przez długi czas. W odróżnieniu od popularnych zamienników, które często ustępują jakością, części OEM z demontażu to rozwiązanie dla kierowców ceniących trwałość i precyzyjne dopasowanie. Sklepy z używanymi częściami często oferują dodatkowe zabezpieczenia, takie jak gwarancje czy możliwość zwrotu, co podnosi komfort i bezpieczeństwo zakupów.\nRynek części używanych jest szeroki, ale nie wszystkie źródła są godne zaufania. Najlepiej wybierać profesjonalne sklepy specjalizujące się w demontażu pojazdów, które oferują szczegółowe informacje o stanie części oraz ich numerach OEM. Takie podejście ułatwia znalezienie idealnie dopasowanego elementu i gwarantuje bezproblemowy montaż. Dzięki rzetelnym opisom i dokładnym danym technicznym, takim jak numer katalogowy, kupujący ma pewność, że wybiera produkt kompatybilny z modelem swojego auta. Sklepy dbające o transparentność i jakość często przeprowadzają dodatkowe testy lub serwis podzespołów przed sprzedażą, co przekłada się na większe bezpieczeństwo i satysfakcję z zakupu. Warto zwracać uwagę na te detale, by uniknąć problemów podczas montażu i późniejszej eksploatacji.\nNaprawa samochodu nie musi oznaczać wysokich kosztów. Korzystając z oryginalnych, używanych części pochodzących z pewnego źródła, możesz skutecznie i bezpiecznie przywrócić sprawność swojego pojazdu, oszczędzając jednocześnie spore kwoty. To rozwiązanie łączące jakość, bezpieczeństwo i rozsądną cenę – idealne dla każdego kierowcy dbającego o swój samochód i portfel. Dzięki ofercie używanych części masz możliwość wymiany kluczowych elementów mechanicznych i elektronicznych bez konieczności inwestowania w drogie, nowe podzespoły.\nJednym z liderów na rynku części używanych jestsklep motoryzacyjny Global Parts, specjalizujący się w demontażu samochodów marek premium, takich jak BMW, Mercedes, Audi czy Mini. Dzięki dużemu magazynowi i profesjonalnemu podejściu oferuje tysiące oryginalnych części, często niedostępnych w autoryzowanych serwisach.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź.

The heroines of the walk will include, among others, Katarzyna Kobro-a sculptor who came to Łódź from the post-revolutionary Russia, Maryla Biedermann-a soldier of the Home Army derived from the family of German manufacturers, Jewish writer Chawa Rozenfarb and Antonina Baptist-organizer of secret teaching of Polish children-says Ewa Kamińska-Bużałek, from the historical department.\nThe next walks will take place: July 19, August 30 and September 13, they will all start at 15:00 at the headquarters of the Main Museum of the City of Łódź (ul. Ogrodowa 15). Additional proposals will include A trip \"Parks over the boat\", telling about green areas along the Łódź river, and a walk around Plac Wolności, full of urban stories and curiosities.\nFrom June 27 to August 29, every Friday at 17:00, the organizers invite you to the holiday series \"Palace for Friday\", on the history of the Palace of the Poznań family and its hybrids.\nWhile visiting, our guests will learn how Israel Poznań built his fortune, how the history of his family went. There will be curiosities about the palace itself and stories about the symbolism of our interiors - encourages Paulina Długosz, a manager of the education department.\nThe fate of the residence at 15 Ogrodowa Street can also be known during the tour \"We invite you to salons ... for half a century\". On each first and third Sunday of the month at 12:00 museum educators will not only tell about the history of the palace, but also reveal how museum exhibitions have changed within fifty years.\nThe Museum of the City of Łódź invites you to exceptional evening guards around the historic Palace of the Poznań family and the adjacent garden. The first of them will take place on June 27, July 11, July 25, August 15, August 29 and finally September 12.\nAfter last year's huge interest in evening guards, we decided to invite it to them this year. We planned five such meetings, each will start at 20, i.e. after closing the museum for individual visitors, which is why guests will have the opportunity to see our exhibitions in an intimate group. Each of the guards will end in the garden, which in the evening takes on a magical character - says Magda Komarkowiec, director of MMŁ.\nThe museum also invites you to an unusual place, which is hidden just below the surface of Plac Wolności - the \"Inner\" channel museum. Every Saturday and Sunday at 12:00, 13:00, 15:00 and 16:00 Visitors have the opportunity to discover the secrets of \"inner tubes\" during special guided tours.\nWhile walking around the underground channel, guests will learn the history of its creation, technical curiosities and the role he played in the life of former Łódź. The guide will also tell about how \"the inner tube\" has become one of the most original museums in Poland - says Magda Komrzerz, director of MMŁ.\nAll detailed and current information can be found on the website of the Museum of the City of Łódź: www.muzeum-lodz.pl.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

And she announced the reconstruction of a demolished tenement house.\nSee also: New life of the tenement house at Nawrot in Łódź. The old building will be the pride of Śródmieście\nThe plan has just taken shape. \"Dziura\" at Piotrkowska Street to look into the eyes. There will be a tenement house of a connoisseur - an intimate building with high standard apartments and finishing common parts in premium quality. Part of the ground floor can be intended for service activities.\n>> The rest of the text is below <<\nThe front of the tenement house will be a reconstruction of the facade of the house, which was part of this section of the frontage of ul. Piotrkowska in the interwar period. The project of current reconstruction was prepared by the studio of the Łódź architect Filip Karczemski based on the documentation of decorations and architectural details of the non -existent tenement house, in which the designer was supported by other Łódź architects Małgorzata and Andrzej Wachowicz.\nEmpty plot at ul. Piotrkowska 58, as well as the neighboring outbuilding at ul. Piotrkowska 56/58 A ladies with an office building (bought in a package from PGE by Budomal; the office building is undergoing a reconstruction for a residential function) are located in the area of ​​the emerging mediocre tunnel. This fact itself forced significant changes in the construction design.\nAll earthworks in the implementation of the connoisseur tenement house, starting with the implementation of the foundations, will be coordinated with the work of the tunnel contractor and the progress of TBM Katarzyna, who will drill him towards the factory station. The task of rebuilding the tenement house will be implemented in parallel with the already ongoing reconstruction of the outbuilding building at ul. Piotrkowska 56/58.\nThere are many challenges and complications, but hope for the definitive patching of a hole in the frontage of ul. Piotrkowska has never been so real before.\nModern standards in city apartments in Łódź. It will be ecologically and energy -saving\nNew apartments at Górna in Łódź?

    "content": "02.06.202511: 25red\nThe Łódź Recycling Center will be built in Łódź, thanks to which residents will gain stable prices and a cleaner environment. This is a response to the growing costs of garbage collection, because of which prices for garbage collection in Łódź will be higher from July. To avoid such increases in the future, the city decides to have a key investment.\nThe Łódź Recycling Center will be built at ul. Wykujska in Łódź. The expansion of the existing sorting plant with a modern biogas plant and a complex for processing bio -way is to be a response to the growing costs of collection and management of waste throughout Poland. The Łódź Recycling Center will be safe, zhre -emission and technologically advanced. Bio -pad processing will take place fully under the roof - without smells and nuisance for the environment. Importantly, waste will turn into a raw material, from which energy and heat will be produced, reaching the local network. This means local, cheaper and independent energy production - benefit for both the environment and the wallets of Łódź.\nThe construction of the Łódź Recycling Center is a response to the growing costs of garbage collection - companies competing in tenders expect higher rates. For this reason, from July, prices for garbage collection will increase by PLN 2.6 in both single -family houses and apartments (while in the case of the latter we are talking about the consumption of a square meter of water, with which the fee for waste collection is associated).\nThe last increase in garbage fees in Łódź took place in 2021, while inflation was significantly lower than today. Since then, the prices of fuel, energy, services and equipment have increased by up to several dozen percent. The new rates, resulting from offers submitted in the tender, which will be decided soon, is only valorisation and adaptation to the real costs presented by companies in tenders. The city does not earn on waste management.\nDespite the changes, Łódź is still below the nationwide average, looking for a balance between the costs and the capabilities of the inhabitants. For single -family houses, fees in individual cities look as follows:\nThis is over 40% below the maximum rate permissible by the Central Statistical Office (PLN 63.34).\nThanks to the new Łódź Recycling Center, waste will no longer be exported to other cities such as Bełchatów or distant Wrocław - everything will be processed locally, which will reduce costs and ensure the self -sufficiency of the system.\nThe waste services market is changing dynamically - companies that support waste collection significantly raised prices. In such a situation, the investment in the Local Processing Center is a strategic step that will reduce the impact of the external market on the finances of the city and residents.\nThe new investment is a guarantee that Łódź is not threatened by situations known from other cities - wild dumps, unpaid waste or price increases by several dozen percent every year. It is stability, purity and ecological responsibility.\nThanks to this investment, Łódź enters the 21st century of waste management. This is a project not only for today, but also for future generations.\nŁódź.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

The basics are solid to fight for something more in the following competitions.\nConstruction finished the season in difficult terrain - in Sopot. The cell definitely had something to fight for, so it wasn't a parsley match at all. The hosts were an obvious favorite, which was reflected in the match. However, the inhabitants of Łódź did not lay down their arms, and the result 41:19 is not a dishonore at all. Looking at the entire construction season, it lacked a flash. Bałut's pride regularly overcame weaker teams, but there was a lack of spark that would allow victory with the tip of the table. Remember, however, that this is the first year after a fairly considerable personnel revolution. The machine is already well oiled, and the trainers know weak points that need to be strengthened in the summer.\nWidzew Łódź is not idle! A new player at Piłsudskiego 138!\nMatch of stars in Łódź.

    "content": "01.06.202519: 51AGR\nRemembering the 1970s in Łódź, one can not ignore the sphere of culture, which in the city of workers' traditions gradually broke in everyday life, obtaining a significant rank and while building the social aspirations of the residents of the factory city.\nAccording to political assumptions, culture was to be a common good, and participation is widely available. The state subsidized all manifestations of artistic activity, which on the one hand was a kind of control, but on the other it released a bit from the pressure of commercialization. At the lowest level, there were district cultural centers and a network of housing establishments, and large factories also run their own, including Poltex, Uniontex, Eskimo or Elta. Of course, professional cultural institutions in Łódź were important, which represented a high artistic level on a national scale.\nOn January 19, 1967, it was open at pl. Dąbrowski Wielki Theater, and it was the second largest opera scene in Poland. It will not be possible to describe 50 years of history of this cultural institutions, hundreds of premieres, thousands of performances, festivals and other artistic events with the participation of many outstanding conductors, musicians, singers, and dancers in a short form. A visit to the Grand Theater had a solemn and prestigious character at that time - rather evening costumes were in force. It was difficult to get for the next opera premieres, and the tickets for ballet meetings quickly disappeared. On the other hand, many high schools or Łódź enterprises offered special passes for the whole season, and the meeting in the opera walls was of a special character. It was similar with concerts at the Lodz Philharmonic, where it was also elegant and moody. Tickets - not only for special events - had to be fought and a certain cultural hunger prevailed in the city, and certainly a type of fashion for the use of artistic goods also from high -end and more massive entertainment.\nImmediately after the war, the Łódź operetta was created, offering a classic repertoire, but under the sign of lighter music, which had its permanent audience in Łódź, and well -known artists joined the stage. From July 17, 1964, the facility began operating at the new headquarters at ul. North and a century ago the audience was usually filled to the brim.\nFrom that period, we must also recall the excellent years of the New Theater in Łódź, headed by Kazimierz Dejmek, who in 1974 took the position of director again and until 1979 staged cult shows, including \"Operetta\" by W. Gombrowicz (1975), \"Garbus\" (1975) and \"Vatzlav\" S. Mrożek (1979) and \"Great Fryderyk\" by A. Nowaczyński (1977). Once again, the director turned to the Old Polish apocrypha, directed by the famous \"Dialogus de Passione\". It was very difficult to get tickets for these performances. It was similar with other Łódź stages: Jaracz, the Universal Theater conducted by Roman Kłosowski or 7.15, belonging to PWSFTVIT.\nBefore the war, Łódź became famous in Poland with the largest number of cinematographers, but it was similar in the times of the Polish People's Republic, because the city loved mass, ludic entertainment. In the post -war years, with the culmination in the 70s, it still wielded the palm of priority with the number of 35 operating cinemas of various categories, with 12 thousand. places in the audience. Queues for cinemas in Łódź, especially for premiere shows or cash paintings, were a common phenomenon, and one of the manifestations of the cultural boom was the activity of the so -called Konik, who sold in front of the cinemas - usually at a double price - tickets, previously acquired at the ticket office. At that time, the norm was also an all -night watching in the queue under the buildings of several premiere cinemas to get a pass for confrontations, i.e. an annual review of world film productions, both popular and artistic, awarded with Oscars or at international festivals, which did not always go to broad distribution. So it was the only opportunity to watch them.\nThe adventures of Papcia Chmiel. Henryk Chmielewski and his Łódź fate\nOutstanding graduates of the Film School in Łódź.

Among them are both quite tiny and larger, wild mammals, which for various reasons do not cope alone in the urban environment.\nParticularly noteworthy are crosswords, which are increasingly appearing in the center. These are wild ducks that were stray from city parks and streets. Females often die in accidents, and their orphaned young fall into the sewage wells or are found unattended. They then go to the wings of the employees of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Center in Łódź, where they are raised. Currently, there are several ducks there, which will be rolled and released in wild, safe places in a timely manner.\nThe center regularly intervenes in the matter of wild animals that enter urban areas. One of the last cases was Daniel, who invaded the school and could not get out of it. He was safely caught and transported to the center. Unfortunately, similar situations happen more and more often - animals enter private properties, cannot find the way back and require people to help.\nIn recent weeks, several young foxes have also hit the resort, including from the kindergarten area. Their mother probably died under the train. In addition, there are interventions related to other small predators - e.g. young kuna, found alone on earth, needed care and shelter.\nSquirrels also often become victims of urban life - they are caught by dogs and cats, fall from the nests or are abandoned by scared mothers. Several of them are now in external aviaries and will soon be released. Jeże goes to the center mainly with wounds after mowing lawns, after dog attacks or weakened after winter. Thanks to the help of veterinarians, they regain strength, are dewormed and return to the freedom.\nAmong the unusual cases there was also a hare brought by a dog - this is a reminder of how important it is to guard pets that can hurt wild species.\nEmployees of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Center in Łódź resemble:\nLet's not take wild animals from parks to the forests.\nLet's not approach young deer - the mother is usually nearby.\nLet's not take rods - young birds learn to fly and do not need intervention if they are not sick.\nIf you meet a wild animal that seems to need help - first call specialists: 42 617 26 86.\nKitek and Kitty are waiting for a new house in a shelter in Łódź.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

Thanks to the consistent actions of the city and the involvement of residents in the Civic Budget Łódź, playgrounds are created and functioning, which are available and friendly to all children - regardless of their efficiency.\nIn recent years, several investments have been implemented taking into account the needs of children with disabilities. Some of them were created as part of the Municipal Program for the area regeneration of the Center of Łódź (Rocł), and some thanks to the ideas of Łódź residents submitted in subsequent editions of the Łódź civic budget (ŁBO).\nIn the very center of Łódź there are playgrounds that offer available devices, safe surfaces and integration space:\nul. Sienkiewicza 56 - Playground available to all children,\nul. Kilińskiego 28 and North 23,\nat the Pinocchio Theater - visa,\nin the parks: Staromiejski (from Wolborska St.), Moniuszko and in Pasaż Majewski,\non the corner of Kiliński and Jaracz-in the Park of Alina Margolis-Edelman,\nul. Tuwima 35.\nIt is worth adding that a safe polyurethane surface was made at Plac Wolności - which is the first step towards further available expansion.\nThanks to the votes of residents, as part of the civic budget, several playgrounds have already been implemented, which respond to the needs of children with disabilities:\nin the park on Jasień (between ul. Śmigły-Rydza, Tymienieckiego and the Kozncza housing estate),\nOn the Square of Maksymilian Kolbe at ul. Rydla and Tatrzańska,\nIn the park Szarych Szeregów at ul. Boy-Żeleński.\nThis is proof that the inhabitants of Łódź know how important it is to create integration spaces - places where every child can play, develop and feel at ease.\nThe city is not slowing down. Currently, there are two investments planned in the \"design and build\" system, which will be completely adapted to the needs of children with disabilities:\nnew playground in the Chojny Park - Zator (ul. Gładka, St. John of God, Foreign, Jutrzenki),\nExpansion of the playground in the Park Father J. Poniatowski (ul. Radwańska/Żeromskiego).\nThese are the next steps on the way to create a more open, equal and friendly to all residents - regardless of age or efficiency.

Thanks to immediate resuscitation and cooperation, many specialists managed to save the life of a young woman.\nDoctors from the Central Clinical Hospital in Łódź fought for the life of a 28-year-old mother and her children for 18 minutes.

See it from the inside - corridors, cash registers and descent to the platforms.\nClick on the photos above to see the gallery from the new Łódź Kaliska station.\nThe beginning of Łódź Kaliskas reed in 1898. When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

Difficult personal experiences meant that she spent the end of her life in poverty and oblivion. Currently, her work is of fundamental importance for modern sculpture, and her supremate works are a phenomenon of European importance.\nKobro co -founded a group of initiators of gathering in a museum in Łódź in the international art collection of the modern group \"A.R.\" - the first collection of works of radical avant -garde in Poland, as well as one of the first in the world created for public presentation. Together with her husband Władysław Strzemiński, she took part in a number of artistic, exhibition, journalistic and publishing projects, which made the center of modernity from Łódź.\nShe belonged to the pioneer of the presence of women in art, emphasizing their importance in the social dimension. For years, overlooked, forgotten, for many she was only a \"wife of Strzemiński.\" This problem of lack of acceptance for women's work took on an absurd dimension in the text of the French critic Gerald Gassiot-Talabot, who in 1966 in \"Art International\" shared with readers his discovery of \"the amazing sculptor named Kobro\" ...\nAfter the death of Katarzyna Kobro (in 1951 in Łódź) some of her works had to be reconstructed, which allowed to learn the scope of innovation and courage of this great form. Many early works have been lost and are known only for the iconographic record. Since the 1960s, museums and artists have been bringing her art to temporary forgetting, and the artist's figure is slowly gaining the features of myth, inspiring subsequent generations of contemporary artists.\nSince 2001, the sculptor has been in a special way to commemorate the Award of Katarzyna Kobro, handed to Polish artists by artists representing various fields of art.\nUnder the seven.

The owners had nothing to do with gastronomy, but they loved the country of our southern neighbors with all their hearts, then Czech beer and finally the kitchen - in this order. So they decided to open in Łódź, away from the city center, a place where they will infect others with their passion.\nThis is the only place in Łódź that serves Czech specialties based on original recipes. The circle of satisfied customers is constantly growing. At the weekend it is difficult to find a free table without prior booking. The intimate interior is filled with photos and posters referring to the history and culture of the Czech Republic. While waiting for our order, we can also watch the adventures of the famous Krecik.\nThe menu is dominated by meat dishes, including Baked duck with dumplings, press ham with horseradish sauce or pork knuckle with sour cabbage. There is also something for less hunger - a potato cream with brine or broth with cheese toast. However, the owners did not forget about vegetarian options. Dumplings with smoked sheep's cheese or breaded Hermelin cheese with blackberry sauce and thyme are just some of the suggestions. Every month there is also a thematic menu, based on seasonal products - May was marked by asparagus.\nRestaurant guests have their favorite dishes. Olomouc cheese with garlic croutons, beef tent with Moravian fried cabbage and cream, beef stew with dumplings and traditional beer are the most popular. After all, when it comes to Czech cuisine, this drink must also appear.

    "content": "31.05.202519: 38 Patravja Trzepiecińska\nHis research can forever change the method of treating herpes. Scientist from the Lodz University of Technology, mgr inż. Patryk Krakowiak, gained international recognition for a breakthrough discovery regarding the HSV-1 virus. The publication in the eminent magazine \"PNAS\" and a prestigious grant from the American Heart Association put him in the group of the most talented young researchers in the USA!\n-The road to a scientific career in the United States was difficult, but inspiring-says Patryk Krakowiak, a Polish researcher, who today conducts his own research on HSV-1 herpes virus in a reputable American laboratory.  It all began with studies at the Lodz University of Technology and a scholarship under the patronage of Fulbright, which, as he emphasizes, opened the door to the world of science at the highest level. In the USA, despite huge competition, he quickly found himself. - The key was patience, openness to new challenges and commitment - says Patryk.\nToday he works in a team where research and ideas are discussed every week in the spirit of cooperation, and the days are filled with experiments, publications and seminars with scientists from around the world. For his work he was awarded the prestigious grant from the American Heart Association - one of the largest organizations supporting medical research in the USA - and the publication in \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\", one of the most important and most valued scientific magazines in the world.\nOver half of the world population is a carrier of the HSV-1 virus, responsible for well-known herpes. - It's a virus that can stay with us for life and is not quiet at all. It can lead to serious neurological diseases, and even be associated with an increased opportunity for the development of Alzheimer's disease - explains a PhD student at the Viginiian University. It is the reactivation mechanism, i.e. the moment when the virus \"wakes up\" from sleep, was until now one of the greatest puzzles of medicine. Until now, it was thought that HSV-1 is activated only when our immunity is weakened, e.g. during infection, stress or fatigue. But the research of the Krakowiak team shows that this is not entirely true. -HSV-1 not only waits for the opportunity-he can wake up. And he has his own mechanism that we had no idea about before - says Patryk.\nDuring the research, Patryk with the team discovered the Ul12.5 protein, which produces the virus itself - and before the body manages to react. This protein damages mitochondria in nerve cells, which activates the body's defense reaction. - Paradoxically, it is our immune system that should defend the body, accidentally helps the virus return to the game - explains Patryk. This discovery changes the look at HSV-1. - Until now, we thought that the virus was waiting for external factors. Meanwhile, it turns out that he has his own \"pilot with the Start button\" and can start his reactivation himself - he says. This knowledge can open the way to completely new treatment methods.\nFor Patrick, science is more than work.  - I am most motivated by the awareness that my work can realistically contribute to improving human health and understanding fundamental biological processes - he says.\nMoments give him the greatest satisfaction when after months of experiments everything begins to make sense.  - It's an amazing feeling, to be the only person in the world for a moment who knows the answer to a given question - he adds. The discovery of the Ul12.5 protein can completely change the approach to the treatment of viruses such as HSV-1. - Instead of interfering with immunity, which can be risky, we can now hit the virus directly - something that he codes and what he needs to activate. This is much more precise and safer - explains the scientist.\nIt is such discoveries that bring us closer to drugs that not only treat symptoms, but can completely stop the relapses of infection.\nHerpes virus (HSV-1) is not only a troublesome change on the lips-more and more research indicates that it may be related to Alzheimer's disease. Scientists suspect that if this virus is activated in the brain many times, it can cause inflammation and lead to the accumulation of harmful proteins that are typical of this disease. The discovery of the Ul12.5 protein can help better understand this process. And in the future? It may even develop drugs that will not only stop herpes, but also delay the development of diseases such as Alzheimer.\nCriminals written between lessons.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

Pyłki w powietrzu, kosmetyki czy soczewki kontaktowe mogą wywoływać zaczerwienienie, świąd i łzawienie oczu, co znacząco obniża komfort treningu. Dowiedz się, jak unikać kontaktu z alergenami, jakie krople do oczu stosować oraz kiedy warto skonsultować się z lekarzem, by cieszyć się aktywnością na świeżym powietrzu bez ograniczeń!\nAlergiczne zapalenie spojówek u biegaczy często ma swoje źródło w obecnościpyłków roślinnychw powietrzu, zwłaszcza w czasie ich intensywnego pylenia. Podczas biegu na zewnątrz można natrafić na te alergeny, co wywołuje reakcję organizmu. Układ odpornościowy zaczyna reagować nadwrażliwie, uwalniając z komórek tucznych spojówki substancje takie jakhistaminaicytokiny, co prowadzi do zaczerwienienia oraz swędzenia oczu.\nIstnieją również inne czynniki pogłębiające objawy alergii oczu u osób uprawiających jogging. Na przykład kosmetyki zawierające drażniące składniki mogą zwiększać podatność oczu na działanie alergenów. Dodatkowo noszeniesoczewek kontaktowychpodczas biegu może potęgować dyskomfort związany z alergicznym zapaleniem spojówek przez utrudnianie naturalnego łzawienia i oczyszczania oka. Dla aktywnych fizycznie kluczowe jest unikanie kontaktu z alergenami podczas treningów na świeżym powietrzu.

Osoby cierpiące na alergię mogą czuć znaczny dyskomfort podczas aktywności fizycznej. Dlatego istotne jest śledzenie prognoz dotyczących pylenia i unikanie biegania na dworze w dniach o wysokim stężeniu alergenów.\nDla biegaczy i innych osób aktywnych dostępne sąkrople do oczu na alergie, które łagodzą objawy alergii.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass.

However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets.

In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

Thanks to the heroic attitude in the two -legged one with Grunwald Poznań, this art was successful. The goal for this season was to be outside the Play-Out zone.\nThe beginning of the competition heralded that this could be a very difficult task. Interlacing victories with failures did not bode well, and at the turn of October and November a series of three defeats in a row happened. The second collapse of the form came in March, but the increases also happened. It is thanks to them, and especially thanks to the good attitude in April, that Anilana took ninth place and can calmly gain strength before new games.\nOrzeł Łódź - Celfast Wilki Krosno.

After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets.

Zbyszek Karolak - founder of Football Pub, the founder of Football Pub, the oldest place for off Piotrkowska, which is the turns of 30 years old, looks at all this with a tear.\nEvery football supporter in Łódź knows this place. Maybe not necessarily by name, but when \"this pub with scarves\" says, everyone knows what's going on. Zbigniew Karolak, a former footballer of Widzewa Łódź, after the end of his career in 1995, he founded Football Pub. From the very foundation, it was to be a place that will connect the fans - regardless of club colors.\nInitially, Manchester United fans, later Liverpool, came here. Now there are most fans of Barcelona - says the owner.\nEvery centimeter of this place is steeped in memories and history. Where to see the scarfs there are scarves. All donated from sympathy for Mr. Zbyszek. Of course, the scarf of beloved Widzewa Łódź appeared on the wall.\nAlmost all of them have its own history. Every time I talk about it, I move hard. The first one that reminds me is the receipt of the Celtic Glasgow scarf. An elderly gentleman came with grandchildren. He asks if there is a Celtic scarf, I replied that I did not have. He announced that when he was next time he would bring. After 3-4 years, the grandfather enters with two young people, I did not meet them at all! Only when this gentleman pulled the Celtic scarf from behind the bosom, it dazzled me - he says with tears in his eyes.\nAmong the favorite stories is also the one associated with the Bayern Munich scarf.\nIt was the famous Champions League final from 1999. Two Bavarians were already preparing to put the queue to all those present, because their team won 1: 0 two minutes before the end of the match. One of them came out literally for a moment, but when he returned the Red Devils won 2: 1. There was no queue, but after a few days they returned and gave me a scarf - recalls Mr. Zbyszek.\n>> The rest of the article is below <<\nThe history of scarves is often intertwined with simple Łódź stories. When the first store of one of the French chains of several employees was opened, Mr. Zbyszek came to the matches of Girondins Bordeaux. They wanted to become part of this place and left a scarf. Still another is intertwined with the history of Widzewa.\nFans from Dortmund came to a rematch in Łódź. They were already in great moods when they entered the premises. I told them that I was a former Widzewa Łódź player and when they visited me the next together, they left their scarf - he says.\nA unique on the world scale is the combined scarf Widzewa Łódź and ŁKS Łódź.\nThis is the definition of this place, the sport is to combine, not divide. Today there are colleagues with me from both RTS and ŁKS. Fans of all clubs are welcome here - says Mr. Zbyszek.\nEach of the over 300 scarves has its own history. Zbigniew Karolak shares them willingly with anyone who visits his premises on off Piotrkowska.\nWidzew Łódź Futsal is falling apart!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

In their place there are decorative hatches made on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of ZWiK Łódź this year.\nOn the castle covers, we will see the inscription \"100 years of ZWiK Łódź\" and dates: 1925-2025. Attention is drawn to the first name of the municipal company \"Sewage and waterworks of the city of Łódź\". This name began with the word: \"sewage system\", because 100 years ago, catching up with civilization delays in the city began with the construction of sewage channels to protect Łódź residents from a sanitary disaster. At that time, more important than providing residents access to clean water was to lead underground collectors of domestic and factory sewage from the city. They were a source of infectious diseases, soil contamination, rivers and underground aquifers.\nFirst, the stinking gutters were disappeared from Śródmieście streets, and only then started to build a municipal water supply network. The 1920s and 1930s were the time of the largest investments: construction of the main sewage collectors, sewage treatment plants in Lubinek, drilling the first three deep wells and the construction of tanks on the slopes.\nOn the jubilee hatch of ZWiK Łódź, letters and a graphic theme were used, which refer to the art deco style fashionable in those years. The letters: \"K\" and \"W\" - the same ones that were present on the first logotype of ZWiK Łódź were incorporated into the graphic motif on the hatch cover. They are an abbreviation for: \"sewage system\" and \"waterworks\". The motif used in the manhole also has a practical dimension - it is anti -slip. Jubilee decorative hatches will appear on the renovated streets in Łódź. They will be installed on the occasion of new sewage investments, and will also replace old, worn -out fittings. The jubilee hatches are to remind you of the service of several generations of employees of the Waterworks and Sewage Plant for the inhabitants of Łódź.\nTOP 10 Woonerfs in Łódź!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

But this is not an ordinary watch! The band can: measure pulse, temperature and pressure, check the level of oxygen in the blood (saturation), detect the fall, and above all - thanks to one SOS button - connect directly with the paramedic. If necessary, the lifeguard may immediately send an ambulance to the place. This is a great support that allows seniors to feel safer in their own home.\nThe program is addressed to the inhabitants of Łódź over the age of 60, after strokes or heart attacks, exposed to the loss of consciousness, having a memory problem, resulting from illnesses or procedures, to disabled and lonely people.\nThe criteria conditioning participation in the project are: living in the city of Łódź, having the status of an dependent person, age over 60 years old. In turn, the criteria rewarding participation in the project are: running a one -man and disability as well as having a disability certificate.\nCurrently, there are 550 such bands in Łódź, which are financed from the city budget. Thanks to the planned contract with the Łódź Voivodship Office, the program will be run by the end of 2025. There are also plans to buy another 50 bands so that even more seniors can feel safe.\nThis is part of the nationwide initiative of the Senior Support Corps, implemented since 2022 by the Ministry of Family, Labor and Social Policy. As much as 80% of costs finance the state, the rest is added by the city. Thanks to such activities, Łódź becomes a place where older residents can feel safe and confident - even when they live alone.\nMore information about projects for seniors: https: //uml.lodz.pl/seniorzy/projekty\nNew preventive program \"My health\".

    "content": "25.05.202521: 15agr\nIn the 1960s, long queues lined up in the yard at ul. Piotrkowska 56. There were usually more than one hundred people who patiently waited for ice cream from Maria Granowska. And although more than half a century has passed since then - because the confectionery operated until 1972 - many Łódź residents still remember their unique taste.\nThe times of the Polish People's Republic were not too sweet, but the mid -1970s of the 20th century can be called a short period of small Dolce Vita - as far as possible the system. The increase in industrial investments, development of construction, relative economic stabilization allowed to look more optimistic to the future, and to use available cultural and entertainment resources on a daily basis. There were several iconic places in Łódź to remember, because they signed up in the history of the city.\nSpeaking of high culture and the successes of Łódź, one should mention the Baltic cinema, which among over 30 others was prestigious in its own way - it was here that friends were invited to a meeting or arranged cultural dates. In the nineteenth-century building of the former German Theater Thalia, and then the Municipal Theater was arranged in 1925. Reduta cinema, then Splendid, and in the 1930s-Europa Cinema. After the war, the facility was nationalized and on July 22, 1958, the Baltician width -screen cinema was launched - one of the largest in Poland. After another modernization in 1967, it became the most modern cinema in the country with a panoramic screen and the Dolby Stereo system. In two projection rooms there were audiences of 780 places, of which there were 471 places on the ground floor and 128 places on the balcony with double sofas. Farewell to the iconic institution, where film emotions were experienced by several generations of Łódź residents, took place on September 20, 2015, and the last painting was \"Promised Land\".\n>> The rest of the article is below <<\nThe cult and best known cafe in Łódź - Honoratka - operated at ul. From the late 1940s, Moniuszko was associated primarily with the environment of the Łódź film school, but the sociable cream of Łódź met here. The legendary SPATIF, which was opened in 1956 at the Lürkens Palace at al. Kościuszki 33/35, was remembered by many well -known directors, actors, people of stage and journalists. Parties and fun - especially in the times of flourishing of production at the Film Film Factory - have grown up with numerous stories. It was similar in the case of a cafe at the Grand Hotel, where well -known filmmakers and film stars stayed, but during the day the tables were occupied by Cinkciars and Women in Furs.\nIt was calmer in Europe. For various reasons, they were not available to everyone, but a tasty cake and good coffee could be consumed on a high stool in the corner pastry shop of the Grandka or in Łódź. The original AGAWA cafe with a terrace at al. Kościuszki, and in Akademicka on the corner of ul. Piotrkowska and ul. Nawrot was played in the bridge in the clouds of cigarette smoke. Student youth sat in the iconic Academic Culture Center 77 or in Irena, and high school students rather visited the estate cafes.\nThe breakthrough was the opening of Hortex confectionery on April 29, 1976 - in the very center of Łódź, at ul. Piotrkowska 106/110 (previously an atmospheric exotic cafe with impressive plants inside and Strzemiński's fresco on the wall operated). This place has also opened their doors for young people and became a favorite meeting place. Outside, traditional ice cream was sold in corners in many flavors, and inside the original desserts were served: black and white ice cream, colorful jelly, cakes, cakes, and above all famous ambrosia, i.e. ice cream with whipped cream, dried fruit and topping. For this good coffee, Coca-Cola or orange juice, which were then a rarity.

Despite this, quite a lot happened to the pitch.\nThe first half belonged to Łódź residents. They played the game and harassed their rivals with subsequent actions. In the 11th minute it brought the effect - Husein Buli came off the right wing and fired. The ball bounced from Oskar Koprowski, which was confused by the helpless goalkeeper Znicz. A few moments later, Gustaf Norlin also hit the goal, but by the burned hit he was not recognized.\nHowever, the most important events of that day took place after the first half. Marek Chojnacki appeared during the break, a former coach of SMS Łódź, but above all the legend of the Łódź Sports Club. On the day of retirement, the former footballer and trainer of the Knights of Spring said goodbye to the fans on the pitch.\nAfter changing sides, the inhabitants of Łódź applauded two more characters. In the 56th minute, assisted by the ovation from the stands, the piro left the pyrave, and ten minutes later Kamil Dankowski went a similar path. For both it was the last performance in white, red and white colors.\nThe image of a touching day was decided to spoil the Pruszków.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

Today, Joanna Dulas home workshop is a brand of unique handicraft decorations, and handmade houses diverge in a few minutes. Each of them is a separate story of a piece of wood.\nJoanna Dulas from Wolborz near Łódź never planned to be professionally associated with wood.\nIt started quite simply. I made a few houses as a gift for friends. I uploaded a photo on a group of ceramics lovers and suddenly I had a box full of messages. In 2022 I founded a home workshop page. Everyone urged me to do so, and I still don't like this name to this day, but it stayed. Since then, the houses have been in every work. For me it is a symbol of warmth, safety, such grandmother climates - explains Joanna Dulas.\nAlthough he emphasizes, she has no artistic education, her work goes to homes all over Poland.\nI've always liked to do something with my hands, I had plastic skills. You don't need a school, but imagination and courage - he adds.\nThere is no catalog in the house workshop, there is no serial production. He usually does several works at the same time. When one dries, it starts the other. He doesn't make sketches. He arranges the houses at Piła, checks if they look good together. Each work is unique. He can't repeat his previous job. There is no longer the same board, the same emotion. Even if something looks similar, it will always be different.\n>> The rest of the article is below <<\nJoanna's wooden decorations arouse emotions and not only at her.\nSometimes I get a message that someone was touched, sometimes that he did not manage to buy, and he really wanted to. It's nice but a bit stressful. I feel responsible that someone is waiting for my work - he explains.\nShe is most touched by children's reactions. A lady wrote to Joanna that her daughter asked: \"Why is this lady doing so pretty?\"\nJoanna most often reaches for recycled wood, demolitions, old barns, abandoned furniture. He loves wood that has already survived, has a soul, his texture, color, unevenness. Although her husband is a carpenter by profession, Joanna does most of the work herself. He has his favorite saw, jigsaws, grinders. Some large machines are afraid - then she asks her husband for help. Each ready work quickly goes to new owners.\nI have only two of my houses at home. Sometimes I leave something \"for a moment\", but soon it ends with someone else. I have the greatest joy when someone writes: \"Live is even more beautiful than in the picture,\" says Joanna.\nCriminals written between lessons.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

    "content": "24.05.202521: 36 Milosze Wika\nThe Olechówka River Valley in Stare Chojny as the best place to drill the city wells in 1908 was indicated by engineer Sir William Heerlein Lindley. He decided that southeast of the old borders of Łódź, between the then villages of Dąbrowa and Grodzisko, there are rich aquifers in the geological layers.\nThe plan assumed to obtain water from five deep wells reaching a donkey deck of the lower chalk (500–800 meters deep). The distance between the wells was to be about 1.5 km, and the water from them was to be directed to the reservoir in Dąbrowa and further, with a crowded pipeline, to the tanks on the slopes. System performance was estimated at 65 thousand. M³ of water daily. The drilling time of one well was estimated for three years.\nLindley claimed that due to the too long drilling time and their high costs, this method of obtaining water should be postponed when there is a significant increase in the demand for water in the city. And so it happened. Łódź residents had to wait more than three decades for the implementation of this project - mainly due to the lack of money for expensive drilling.\nThe first urban well was drilled in the village of Górki Stare (today Zygmunta Street) - it is 782 meters of depth. The water flowed from it in 1937, after three years of drilling. The inhabitants of Łódź were eagerly waiting for clean water, because they only had the one drawn from shallow backyard wells, most often contaminated with industrial bacteria and sewage. The water of them was distasteful, hard and iron, was not suitable for washing and bathing. After heating, it got red and cloudy.\n>> The rest of the article is below <<\nThe well at Zygmunta Street is the oldest and still open city well. The age of water from this well was estimated for almost three thousand years - so it can be assumed that it comes from rainfall and snow thaws that occurred in Poland in the historic Bronze Age. It is originally clean, devoid of all civilization pollution.\nWater from the oldest well in Łódź, through the treatment station in Dąbrowa, goes to the tanks on the slopes, and from there flows to the houses of Łódź. Currently, the inhabitants of Łódź use water from 46 deep shots. ZWiK Łódź employees control them systematically. Using a deep camera, the technical condition of the wells is monitored so that they can serve Łódź residents for the next years. The best proof of proper care for the state of the well is the fact that the oldest, drilled before World War II or right after it (in the 1950s many), still work and press water into the network, significantly exceeding Lindley's estimates as to their life (he assumed a maximum of 30 years of use).\nThe building of the oldest urban deep well has an interesting architectural form. It was erected in the Art Deco style. In the same style, a deep well building at Column Street and technical facilities at water reservoirs on the slopes were also designed. They all have characteristic rosette windows. They are also protected by a monument conservator.\nCulture in Łódź in the 70s The Great Theater, Operetta Łódź and Cinema\nUnder the seven.

See it from the inside - corridors, cash registers and descent to the platforms.\nClick on the photos above to see the gallery from the new Łódź Kaliska station.\nThe beginning of Łódź Kaliskas reed in 1898. When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź. However, behind the station building was built -up for cars.\nAs much as PLN 240 million for repairs of provincial roads in Łódź. These are important episodes! [DETAILS]\nZWiK Łódź saves monuments!

During the meeting with the club, two players will say goodbye.\nIn recent years, it is difficult to find a more disappointing season performed by ŁKS Łódź than this ending. The inhabitants of Łódź were to join at least the fight for the play -offs for the Premier League, and they end the games in the middle of the rate, which is a result far from expectations.\nIn recent months, the atmosphere around the club could actually be cut with a knife. Two coaching experiments - with Jakub Dziółka and Ariel Galeano - simply did not burn, and the team's game looked worse. The ray of hope turned out to be short, but so far the perfect term of Ryszard Robakiewicz.\nThe temporary trainer of the knights of spring has four wins in four matches played. He can end his adventure as the first coach with an impressive series of five consecutive wins. This will be aiming at at least after the end of the competition to give fans some reason to be happy.\nZnicz Pruszków, one of the revelations of this season, will come to Łódź. Both teams have their bills to equalize, because in the first round the Łódź residents released their victory from their hands at the very end.\nThe last match of this season is also the last performance in the white, red and white colors of Piro and Kamil Dankowski.

    "content": "24/05/20257: 58 -party sponsored\nThe choice between Audi AVANT TFSI E A A6 Limousine TFSI E is a decision that requires thoroughly analyzing many aspects. Both models represent the highest quality of German engineering, offering advanced plug-in hybrid technology, which combines the power of an internal combustion engine with ecological riding on the current. The Audi brand has always been famous for its uncompromising approach to quality and innovation, and both of these models perfectly reflect this, ensuring unparalleled driving experience, elegant appearance and impressive fuel saving.\nOne of the most noticeable differences between the Audi A6 Avant Tfsi E a A6 Limousine Tfsi E is of course the trunk capacity. Model Avant, which is a station wagon, offers a much larger cargo space, which makes it an ideal choice for families or people leading an active lifestyle. The trunk in the Avant version has not only a larger base capacity, but also a more practical shape, enabling the transport of irregular objects. The functionality of the luggage space in the Avant model works exceptionally well during longer holiday trips, weekend trips out of the city or simply everyday shopping: https: //www.audi.pl/pl/modele/a6/a6-avant-tfsie-e/.\nIn contrast, Audi A6 Limousine TFSI E has a more elegant, slim figure, which for many is the embodiment of the premium business class: https: //www.audi.pl/pl/modele/a6/a6-limousine-tfsi-e/. Despite the smaller capacity of the trunk, the sedan offers sufficient space for business needs and typical urban travels. It should also be noted that in the case of plug-in hybrids, due to placing the battery, the trunk capacity is slightly smaller than in the classic versions of these models.\nDriving properties are another aspect that can decide about the choice between Avant and Limousine. Although both models divide the same advanced technical platform, there are some subtle differences in their behavior on the road. Sedan, due to their design and lower gravity, offers a slightly more dynamic driving experience, as will be appreciated by sports driving enthusiasts. Limousine works better on winding roads, ensuring more precise handling and better cornering. Avant, despite a slight difference in mass, also offers impressive dynamics, but its main advantage is greater comfort, especially when covering long distances.\nIt is worth mentioning that both models are equipped with an identical plug-in drive system. This means that both Avant and Limousine offer the same power and acceleration. The hybrid system consists of an efficient gasoline engine cooperating with a powerful electric motor, which translates into impressive performance while maintaining low fuel consumption. The driving in electric mode allows you to cover up to several dozen kilometers without emissions, which is ideal for everyday commuting or shopping.\nElectric range is a key parameter for each plug-in hybrid. A6 Avant TFSI E and A6 Limousine TFSI E offer a similar range on the current itself. This is a value that covers most of the daily communication needs of the average driver. It is worth emphasizing that the actual range may vary depending on many factors.\nAudi also took care of the convenience of charging batteries in both models. This process can be carried out both at home using a standard socket and at public charging stations. For people who have the ability to install a Wallbox in their garage, charging time is significantly shortened. The detailed information on charging and electrical range can be found on the official Audi website: https: //www.audi.pl/pl/strefa-klient/elektromobilnosc/sasieg/."

Sterling. Originally, the hospital was intended for the Jewish population, it had a synagogue and kosher kitchen. In the interwar period, however, everyone was treated regardless of his religion. Immediately after the war, barracks were located in the hospital building. In 1947, the facility was opened as the Clinical Hospital of the Seweryn Sterling, where a well -known cardiology clinic was created, led in 1958–1983 by prof. Jan Molla. In 1969, the first heart transplant attempt in Poland was made here.\nThe Poznań family founded another medical institution. Like Karol Scheibler in 1911–1913, the Society of Aquatic I.K. Poznański built another hospital for the workers and their families. Józefa at ul. Drewnowska 75. During World War I, there was a lazaret for wounded soldiers fighting in the battle for Łódź. From 1915, the hospital again served the workers of the Poznań plant. During World War II, the building was within the Litzmannstadt Ghetto borders as a ghetto hospital No. 2, which was liquidated during the so -called Wielka Szpher, and patients were killed in a camp in Chełmno nad Nerem.

This question becomes the starting point for the unusual Escape Truck project. A specially adapted semi -trailer is reproduced by the conditions in which victims of trafficking can be kept. The participants' task - people over 16 - is to get out of the inside with the help of cunning, cooperation and logical thinking.

It was developed by the Dutch Reshape Foundation, the Dutch police, the Police Headquarters, the Border Guard, the University of Wrocław (Center for Trafficking in People) and the embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Poland.\nIn the Łódź Voivodeship, actions are coordinated by police prevention who will spread knowledge about what trafficking in human and how to defend against it really is.\nA new common room for children and youth at North in Łódź.

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new.

It was founded in 1945 as a Public Universal School in Retkini, the Łódź poviat. A year later, after turning Retkini to the borders of Łódź, the facility changed its name to Public Universal School No. 137 in Łódź.\nCurrently, the school has two locations: at ul. Florecists and ul. Olympi, but originally located in an old red brick building at ul. Retekńska. She moved to Florecists on September 1, 1974, and two years later she gained a sports part with a swimming pool, which is used not only by students, but also the residents of the estate.\nThe patron of the school - since 1980 - is prof. Aleksander Kamiński, author of \"Stones for the Lair\". In the same year, the parents' council funded a school banner. The facility has a chamber of tradition, devoted not only to the patron, but also the history of Retkini.\nIn 2025, there are 29 departments in the institution, in which 728 young people study. Most students are in classes I - 116, in IV - 100 and in VII - 99. Due to the development of the Retkinia estate and the growing number of students, the second location proved to be necessary, because at ul. Florecists got too tight for everyone.\nThe renovation of the nursery in Bałuty in Łódź took off. There will be 55 new places at Rydzowa!\nGreat successes of the ballet school in Łódź!

When Tsar Nicholas II accepted the plan to build the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line, on the route in 1902 the first Art Nouveau building of the station stood. After the war, he was not taken care of and demolished in the 1980s.\nIn its place, in the next decade, a postmodern objective of the 90s was filled with colorful metal and glass. The second object grew quickly. Already in 2020, work began on the modernization of platforms and launching the journey through the eastern viaduct of the Łódź Kaliska station. However, the modernization of the building itself with waiting rooms and cash registers began in 2023.\nAt that time, the entire building of the Łódź Kaliska station was comprehensively modernized, leaving only construction walls from the previous one. The building gained a simple, glass, three -nave block. Oxidized copper facade sheet was used outside, and the interior was finished in light brown colors.\nYou can find part of the article below.\nIn the new building of the Łódź Kaliska station there were ticket offices, new passenger information, waiting room, children's corner, service and commercial premises as well as toilets. We can get to railway platforms through the main hall of the Łódź Kaliska station. A novelty will be the transition to platforms 4-6 and communication with the PKS station. In addition, architectural barriers have been leveled, which will facilitate the use of people with disabilities.\nThe station square was also modernized, where the clock tower is new. A roofed parking lot for bicycles and stops was also created, which soon returns MPK Łódź.
